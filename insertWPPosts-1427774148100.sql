    'Learn because you could change the world.  Learn because you will be empowered.  Learn because you absolutely can.

Nothing can stop you, except maybe yourself.

The subject of this blog is
<blockquote><em>Learning New Things</em></blockquote>
because learning, when engaged in freely, is the core of fun and the reason our civilization survives.
<!--more-->
I am passionate about learning because I had the privilege of attending two unusual schools: <a href="http://www.avalonschool.org">Avalon School in Minnesota</a>, and <a href="http://www.hampshire.edu/">Hampshire College in Massachusetts.</a> In both places I was given the freedom to design my own plan of education, and I discovered an amazing secret:
Learning is fun.
It makes sense when you think about it: most forms of recreation involve tackling challenges of increasing difficulty. This requires the practice of known skills and the development of new skills, leading to the thrill of overcoming each challenge. In <em>A Theory of Fun</em>, Raph Koster says it particularly well;
<blockquote>"Fun from games arises out of mastery.  It arises out of comprehension.  It is the act of solving puzzles that makes games fun.

In other words, with games, learning is the drug."</blockquote>
Since finishing college, I have continued learning. I have learned to play guitar, paint faces, cook chicken, make homemade paper, make ATCs, code HTML, fight with two foam "swords", speak Spanish, customize wordpress themes, press flowers, sing in a choir, and more. I am still learning. All of this has been possible because people shared what they knew; on the internet or in books or face to face. I want to share my knowledge too. Everyone deserves the thrill of learning something new.
It''s never too late to start.
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">"Success</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Whippets love wombats and cheaters love rules,</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">like canaries love cats and truants love school.</p>

<h3>Tips for Learning New Things:</h3>

It''s

And it
<h3>allows interaction</h3>
between creator and audience, as well as between creators and audiences.

&nbsp;

Everyone has a message.  You have something to share with the world.  The question is, how will you share your message?

A book?  A pamphlet?  A speech?  A painting?  A song?

Or will you design a website?
<!--more-->
<h2>My experience:</h2>
I have a passion for art, and I was sharing that with the world through my in-person work teaching children, a written thesis that is archived in several places, and through the display of my paintings.
My audience in this case was segmented and limited. My knowledge and vision could only be shared with groups of 10-30 children from my area, individuals with access and a reason to read my thesis, (most likely other art education students), and people physically present who saw my paintings.

Enter deviant art- I was able to make my paintings available to the user base of over 13 million, as well as finding that much more art and inspiration at my fingertips.

[caption id="attachment_255" align="alignleft" width="260" caption="A Very Lopsided Bar Graph"]<a href="/static/2011/10/audience-graph1.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-255" title="Potential Audience Bar Graph" src="/static/2011/10/audience-graph1.png" alt="" width="260" height="648" /></a>[/caption]

Note that not only is my message available to that many more people, but I also have access to the messages of that many more people.
The caveat, of course, is that there is no way that every member of Deviant art will view my art. Still, the <strong>possible</strong> audience has been multiplied by a million. It''s also far easier to hand out a link to my 13 in-person contacts than to lug around my physical portfolio of work.

So putting content on the internet expands your audience. That''s a great reason to get your content online, but why not settle for joining an online community like deviantart, facebook, or livejournal?
<h2>Why have a unique site?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Focuses on representing one individual or company.</li>
	<li>Communicate extra things to visitors through the layout itself: the design of a website tells users which pieces of content are most important, which ones are connected, and what feelings and concepts to associate with the message.</li>
	<li><strong>THE BIG SECRET:</strong> Interactivity. Communication goes both ways! Web design is the only artistic medium which allows communication to flow in both directions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why I love Web Design</h2>
As an art teacher, I was designing experiences for my students. By putting out certain materials, changing the physical environment of the classroom, and giving students information, I created experiences to teach students about art and foster creativity.

By creating a website, I am also designing an experience. The experience will be available to a wider audience, and it can change to meet the needs of individual. This specific aspect of the design is called User Experience, also known as UX design.

Making graphics for websites is fun, but I have to admit that the ability to create an experience, by using the interactive nature of websites, is most exciting thing about web design.

Now you know the secret. <em>Pass it on!</em>

<h3>Web Hosting Explained</h3>
(the text only version)
The computer that you use, (client computer), sends out a request for a website when you enter the <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> (www.example-url.com) into your browser.  A web page is really just a set of files or data (<abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, and sometimes other types).  To find that data, your computer needs an <abbr title="Internet Protocol Address">IP address</abbr>, just like you would need an address to find a location in real life.  A special computer called a <abbr title="Domain Name Server">DNS</abbr> (domain name server) tells your computer what <abbr title="Internet Protocol Address">IP address</abbr> to send it''s request to.  Your computer requests the data from this other computer, called a server, and that computer sends it to you.  “Web Hosting” is what it''s called when a server houses and serves the data for a website.  Finally, your browser displays the data in the form of a web page.  All in the blink of an eye!

<h3>Getting your website online</h3>
You will need:
<ol>
<li>A unique domain name (the <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>). <a href="http://www.namecheap.com/domains/domain-name-search.aspx" title="See what domain names are available">See what domain names are available!</a></li>
<li>The HTML, CSS, and other files, (like javascript, PHP, image files, and other code snippets) that will determine the content, style, and functionality of your website. (See my <a href="http://flarnie.com/web-design-resources/" title="Web Design Resources">Web Design Resources</a> to learn more about creating these files.)</li>
<li>Space on a web host server.</li>
</ol>

You can do the work of attaining these parts individually, or get a package deal that more or less takes care of everything.  Let''s look at some options:
<h3>Website for Anyone:</h3> 
Sign up at <a href="https://en.wordpress.com/signup/" title="wordpress.com sign up">Wordpress.com</a>.
Yes, it''s really that simple.
Pros:
<ul style="list-style: none;"><li>+Free</li>
<li>+No web knowledge needed! </li>
<li>+Wordpress.com takes care of all three steps for you in one easy form.</li>
</ul>
Cons:
<ul style="list-style: none;"><li>-Limited choices of layout and domain names.</li>
<li>-Limited functionality, this type of site works best for blogs.</li>
<li>-Advertising appears on your blog.<li>
</ul>
Tips: If you''re not creating a blog, use a <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Creating_a_Static_Front_Page " title="creating a static front page">static home page</a> on your wordpress.com site.
<h3>Web site for the Web Savvy:</h3>
Sign up with a web host (check some great website hosts <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5911651/five-best-web-hosting-companies" title="reviews of best web hosts 2012">here</a>) and use <a href="http://www.cpanel.net/" title="cPanel">cPanel</a> to set up wordpress or another content management system.
Try a <a href="http://www.cpanel.net/products/cpanelwhm/try-demo.html" title="cPanel demo">cPanel demo</a> to see if this option is for you.
Pros:
<ul style="list-style: none;"><li>+Low cost, as little as a couple dollars per month!</li>
<li>+Increased options for layout, even without knowing any <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> or <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr></li>
<li>+Some hosts will take care of all the details for you.</li>
</ul>
Cons:
<ul style="list-style: none;"><li>-Limits may be set on your file space depending on your server.</li>
<li>-Limited choices for what systems to use when setting up your website.</li>
<li>-Your website may load slowly because of restrictions/sharing of server resources (CPU, memory, bandwidth, etc.)<li>
</ul>
Tips: For beginners, playing with the CSS/HTML in wordpress themes is a good way to learn.  If you want to write the CSS/HTML files from scratch, try to set up a local webserver, so you can test the code before putting it on your live website.
<h3>Web site for the Web Wizard:</h3>
Some web hosts give you more freedom and customization.  Examples include <a href="http://www.linode.com/" title="linode">linode</a>, <a href="http://www.slicehost.com/" title="slice host">slicehost</a>, and <a href="http://tech.coop/Hosting%20Services" title="tech coop">tech coop</a>.
Pros:
<ul style="list-style: none;"><li>+Complete (or nearly complete) freedom to customize</li>
<li>+Allows the development of web applications</li>
</ul>
Cons:
<ul style="list-style: none;"><li>-May cost more</li>
<li>-Requires serious systems administration qualifications to set up and manage.</li>
</ul>
Tips: Hey, if you''re a Web Wizard then I should be asking YOU for tips! : )

So what is metadata?
<blockquote>"Simply put, metadata is data about data.”</blockquote>
-<a href="http://kb.iu.edu/data/aopm.html" title="Metadata defined">Indiana University IT</a>
<!--more-->
Metadata appears on this very page!  See the "Posted on" date at the top?
And the license and categories at the bottom of the post?


These tell you things about the post.  If you''ve been on the web, you''ve probably seen metadata all over the place.
<h3>So what is "Embedded" Metadata?</h3>
If it''s embedded, that means it''s stuck inside of the webpage.  The data is there, possibly invisible to humans, but written into the code.  This is achieved with the use of specific semantic (meaningful) tags to identify certain types of data in an HTML document.

<h3>A bit of history:</h3>
<blockquote>“HTML has a tag called the META tag. One variant of it allows you to -- invisibly -- document the keywords about the page. People used to do this all the time and search engines used to index the keywords on a page. But they were completely invisible. What happened? They got out of sync. Documents got updated; their keywords didn''t. And no one noticed, because you couldn''t view the keywords when you looked at the document. The META tags also got abused. People put in long lists of hundreds and hundreds of keywords that had nothing to do with the content. So they became useless.”</blockquote>
-2005, Tantek Çelik, senior technologist at Technorati, in <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=1247" title="Tantek Celik Reference">"What''s the Next Big Thing on the Web? It May Be a Small, Simple Thing -- Microformats"</a>

Since then, three different formats have developed to allow inclusion of metadata in HTML without the pitfalls of the META tag.  

<h3>Microdata, RDFa, and Microformats:</h3>
<dl>
<dt><strong>RDFa</strong></dt>
<dd>highly complex system, connected to XHTML.</dd>
<dt><strong>Microformats</strong></dt>
<dd>widely used and supported, they mainly rely on the use of plain old (X)HTML tags.</dd>
<dt><strong>Microdata</strong></dt>
<dd>relatively new, used and supported by Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo!.  Less complex than RDFa, but more complex than microformats.</dd>
</dl>

No matter which of the three you choose to use, you get at least some of the following benefits:
<ul>
<li>Search engines use them to categorize and display search results on the web. (<a href="http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=99170" title="Google''s Rich Snippets">Google''s rich snippets</a>, for example)</li>
<li>More and more web pages are using them to make information easy to find. (<a href="http://notsorelevant.com/2007-07-02/hcard-support-for-facebook/" title="facebook hcard app">facebook''s hcard application</a>, for example)</li>
<li>Future web browsers and programs will (very likely) use these tags to parse information.</li>
</ul>

My personal preference was initially Microformats.  They are simple, and widely used as a result.  However, there are two big reasons to choose Microdata:
<ul>
<li>With the release of schema.org, Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo! have all agreed to support and expand microdata.  (<a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/06/introducing-schemaorg-search-engines.html" title="Google Announces Schema.org">Announced</a> as recently as 6/2011!)</li>
<li>combines the simplicity of microformats with the flexibility of RDFa</li>
</ul>

How to get started with Microdata:
<ol>
<li>Check out <a href="http://www.schema.org/" title="schema.org">Schema.org</a> and the still-developing <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/microdata.html" title="Microdata Specification">Microdata Specification</a></li>
<li>Focus on popular and widely used types of microdata, starting with the ones supported NOW by Google. (<a href="http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=176035" title="Google Supports Microdata">Google Supported Microdata</a>)</li>
<li>Remember: You don''t have to mark up every possible property of each item!</li>

Inkscape is the free (no cost and open source) program for creating vector graphics.  It''s like Adobe Illustrator, or CorelDraw, but free.  If you''re just getting started with vector graphics, check out the links at the end.

This tutorial illustrates the 5 steps of making a picture "kawaii", or cute, using Inkscape:

<h3>5 steps to Kawaii</h3>
The text of the tutorial and some Inkscape-specific tips:
I''m going to start with the following vector drawing, a rendition of my PC set-up at home:
<a href="/static/2011/10/home-pc.jpg"><img src="/static/2011/10/home-pc.jpg" alt="" title="home-pc" width="500" height="397" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-352" /></a>
<ol>
<li><b>Curves in all the right places</b>
how to do this in inkscape:
To add curves to squares, select the square tool and drag the little circle handles on your square shape.
<a href="/static/2011/10/curves-on-rectangles.jpg"><img src="/static/2011/10/curves-on-rectangles-1024x732.jpg" alt="" title="curves-on-rectangles" width="640" height="457" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-354" /></a>
To add curves to polygons, use the node tool and place two new nodes on either side of the corner node.  Then select the corner node and delete it, making a curve between the two new nodes.
<a href="/static/2011/10/curves-with-nodes.jpg"><img src="/static/2011/10/curves-with-nodes-1024x887.jpg" alt="" title="curves-with-nodes" width="640" height="554" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-355" /></a>
To add curves in general, change the stroke style of all shapes to "round join" and "round cap".
<a href="/static/2011/10/curves-with-strokestyle.jpg"><img src="/static/2011/10/curves-with-strokestyle-1024x836.jpg" alt="" title="curves-with-strokestyle" width="640" height="522" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-356" /></a></li>
<li><b>Soft, creamy colors.</b>
Even make the “stroke” a paler shade than simply black!
How to do this in inkscape: On the menu bar, find "Object">"Fill and Stroke", this opens a panel for changing the colors.</li>
<li><b>Add a face! And make strokes thicker.</b>
Find inspiration from the <a href="http://sugarlette.deviantart.com/gallery/?offset=24#/d1pkfid" title="Kawaii Faces Reference">Kawaii Faces Reference</a>, by <a href="http://sugarlette.deviantart.com/" title="Sugarlette on Deviantart">Sugarlette</a> on Deviantart.  Make most stroke outlines the thickness of the mouth, I usually go with 2px.</li>
<li><b>Pastel patterned background</b>
Making a background deserves it''s own tutorial.  My general advice is use guides and lots of copy-pasting, simple shapes and monochromatic colors.</li>
<li><b>White solid outlines (adding an “outer stroke”)</b>
There is no easy way to do this in Inkscape.  My method involves several steps.
<ul>
<li>Group your main image into one object.  Then make a copy.<a href="/static/2011/10/group-and-copy.jpg"><img src="/static/2011/10/group-and-copy-1024x625.jpg" alt="" title="group-and-copy" width="640" height="390" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-357" /></a></li>
<li>Put a dark background beneath the copy.  Make the fill and stroke white, and increase the stroke size. <a href="/static/2011/10/make-it-white.jpg"><img src="/static/2011/10/make-it-white-1024x625.jpg" alt="" title="make-it-white" width="640" height="390" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-358" /></a></li>
Note: This may cause problems if you have areas that were previously unfilled, like the cords that hang below the desk in my image.  Those can be fixed at the end.
<li>Last step!  Put the white copy beneath the original, but above the background.  If any areas didn''t have fill in the original, select them individually and set the fill to clear. <a href="/static/2011/10/place-and-adjust.jpg"><img src="/static/2011/10/place-and-adjust-1024x638.jpg" alt="" title="place-and-adjust" width="640" height="398" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-359" /></a></li>
</ul>
</ol>

<h3>Bonus cuteness!</h3>
You get extra points for cute animals, hearts, stars, rainbow colors, and sweet tasty foods.  
I''d like to see how many things can be made cute.  A chainsaw?  A bowl of oatmeal?  A naked mole rat?  The possibilities are endless.

    '<h2>What is a CSS Reset?</h2>
A CSS Reset is a chunk of CSS code which defines baseline styles for some (or all) HTML elements. There are a plethora of CSS Reset stylesheets out there, and it''s easy to write your own.
<h2>Why use a CSS Reset?</h2>
Different browsers use varied default style settings, and these differences can screw up your layout! Resetting these styles to one base evens out the differences, meaning fewer cross-browser issues when designing a website.
And in the end, there is little to lose. A very basic CSS Reset takes up little space and can be easily over-written if it presents any problems.
<h2>How To Use a CSS Reset:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Either write your own or copy-paste a free version into the <strong>top</strong> of your style.css.</li>
	<li>Alternately, you can save the CSS Reset in a different file, (reset.css), and then call it at the <strong>top</strong> of your style.css.</li>
</ul>

<h2>My Experiences:</h2>
<h3>Too Little!</h3>
I began my earlier (hand-coded) website design began with a “standard reset”, but then I switched to WordPress and created a child-theme to give my site a make-over. I had assumed the parent theme included a CSS reset, but it doesn''t! To add a reset I would have to edit the parent theme directly, and re-edit it each time the parent is updated.
<h3>Too Much!</h3>
I recently tried out the “Shape” theme as a WP theme development framework, and it includes a large and thorough CSS Reset, as well as a separate CSS Rebuild stylesheet. Designing without any worries about browser-specific style defaults was great, but the Reset/Rebuild felt rather bulky. I found that by the end of my design, I had overwritten most of the reset and rebuilt CSS values, meaning the elements had values reassigned 2 or 3 times. In my humble opinion, that is too much extra code.
<h3>Just Right: My current CSS Reset</h3>
There are a plethora of CSS reset stylesheets to choose from, and it''s also easy to write your own. After reviewing the most popular versions, I made my own hybrid CSS Reset. It does 4 things:
<ol>
<ol>
	<li>Eliminate extra margin and padding.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<pre lang="css">html, body, div, span, applet, object, iframe,
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p, blockquote, pre,
a, abbr, address, cite, code,
del, dfn, em, font, img, ins, kbd, q, s, samp,
small, strike, strong, sub, sup, tt, var,
b, u, i, center,
dl, dt, dd, ol, ul, li,
fieldset, form, label, legend,
table, caption, tbody, tfoot, thead, tr, th, td {
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
}</pre>
<ol>
<ol>
	<li>Standardize font sizes with % measurements.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<pre lang="css">p{font-size:100%;}
h1{font-size:160%;}
h2{font-size:150%;}
h3{font-size:140%;}
h4{font-size:120%;}</pre>
<ol>
<ol>
	<li>Set HTML5 elements to display as blocks.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<pre lang="css">/* HTML5 display-role reset for older browsers */
article, aside, details, figcaption, figure, 
footer, header, hgroup, menu, nav, section {
        display: block;
}</pre>
<ol>
<ol>
	<li>Set the HTML5 element "del" to display in a standard way.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<pre lang="css">del {
        text-decoration: line-through;
}</pre>
Resetting padding and margins is the most basic thing that (from what I''ve seen) is always done as part of a CSS reset. Dealing with HTML5 tags is, of course, a very recent feature of some CSS resets. Other resets remove styling on lists and remove all font styles, but I don''t want to go that far in my own.
And of course, my version isn''t perfect. I''ll be testing it and making changes as needed.
<h2>Tips for using a CSS Reset:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Do reset the padding and margins for body and html, as well as other elements that you don''t want to style individually. Will you really want to specify the margins for h1 and p every time you write a new design?</li>
	<li>If you''re in a hurry, just grab the latest version of Eric Meyer''s <a title="CSS Reset: Revisited" href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2011/01/03/reset-revisited/">CSS Reset</a>, it''s considered a standard.</li>
	<li>CSS Reset is most helpful when starting a new website, don''t worry too much about adding it to finished sites.</li>

    '<h2>To Grid, or Not to Grid?</h2>
The more I read about CSS Grid Frameworks, the more impressed I was with the idea.  A framework that has a customizable grid structure built in?  Really?  Sounds like something that would require fancy javascript or PHP voodoo.  
Reading the code inside a CSS Framework was a bit like seeing ''Santa'' take off his beard.  It is clever, but not as cool as having the grid positioning system built into CSS would be.
<!--more-->
<h2>So what is a CSS Grid?</h2>
A CSS grid framework is a set of classes that assign standardized widths to elements of the HTML.  The grid is made up of columns and margins, and in a static layout the width of any given number of columns will be constant.  A box that is 3 columns wide will take up a certain width, a box of 5 columns width will be wider, and a 1 column box will be smaller.  Margin size is also constant.  So, if you want an element to be 2 columns wide, assign it the ''2-col'' class, and the CSS grid framework will give it the desired width and margins.
Different Grid Frameworks have different names for the ''columns'' and ''margins'', and other secondary features in their frameworks, but the idea behind the grid seems to be constant.
<h2>Why use a CSS Grid Framework?</h2>
<ul>
<li>People are used to seeing grid layouts in magazines and newspapers.  Having an underlying grid structure my increase the usability and aesthetic appeal of yoru web design.</li>
<li>Grids may be a standard CSS feature in the future. The W3C is drafting a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-grid/" title="CSS3 Grid Specification">grid positioning module for CSS</a>.</li>
<li>Most designers end up using a grid-like structure, so why not be organized about it from the start?</li>
</ul>
<h2>CSS Frameworks</h2>
<dl>
<dt>CSS Frameworks-</dt>
<dd>a base of code to build your own (CSS) designs on top of.</dd>
</dl>
When you end up using the same chunks of code in every project, it''s nice to have them all ready to go when you start a new project.  In general coding, this is called ''boilerplate code''.  An example is the <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/" title="HTML5 boilerplate">HTML5 Boilerplate</a>, a framework that includes a lot of useful ''boilerplate code'' for building sites.
A typical part of a CSS Framework is a CSS Reset.  See my <a href="http://flarnie.com/2011/web-design/how-to-use-a-css-reset/" title="How To Use a CSS Reset">previous entry</a> if you''re curious about those!
<h2>Fluid CSS Grids</h2>
I wanted a css grid that also allowed for responsive design.  This means it could be reused for different screen sizes and devices, like smart phones.  To this end, using a fluid design is the best approach unless you have a fixed element or image-heavy content that you must design around.  (A List Apart has a <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/" title="Responsive Design Articlle">great article</a> if you want to know more about "responsive design".)
	The only existing fluid grid I found was the <a href="http://cssgrid.net/" title="1140 CSS Grid by A. Taylor">1140 CSS Grid by Andy Taylor</a>, so kudos to him.  This framework wasn''t high on the lists of commonly chosen frameworks, and seems relatively new.  Still, I was impressed when I read through the code.
	I took the best of what I saw in the 1140 CSS Grid and in other frameworks, and I''ve drafted a little grid framework of my own to play with.  I''m using my own grid framework in my current design project; it will be interesting to see how it effects the process.  
I''m still on the fence about whether using a grid as part of the design process makes sense for me, but it''s clear that in some cases a CSS Grid Framework can increase efficiency and give you beautiful organization.

<h2>Tips for learning to use CSS grid frameworks:</h2>
<ul>
<li>LOOK AT THE CODE.  If you know CSS then it is the easiest way to understand them.</li>
<li>Remember, grids are standard in print design.  There is nothing new or scary about using a grid in design!</li>
</ul>

I ran into this question when trying to position logo images within a header.  It took me a while to really understand absolute positioning, but now I see how useful it can be!  
Read on if you want to learn more about CSS positioning, with the help of a cute emu.
A note: For positioning a footer at the bottom of your web page, see some useful links at the end!

<!--more-->
<h2>Example: Emma the Emu</h2>
<div style="border-style:solid;
border-width:5px;">

<img style="border:5px solid #6e5813;" src="/static/2011/11/emma-emu-3.png" alt="Emma the Emu" title="emma-emu-3" width="146" height="149" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-461" /></div>
  My little emu img and it''s containing div both have borders, (brown and black), but no other styles have been applied.  This is the default layout.  So what''s that space beneath the image border?  It''s not padding or a margin: setting padding and margin to zero on the img and containing div have no effect.  Adding to the ''levitating emu'' effect is the transparent space within the png image, making poor Emma float within the image border as well as within the containing div!
Let''s say I want this emu to stand on my header, or inside of a side-bar.  CSS can position Emma so that she''s got her feet on the ''ground''.


<h2>How to position your <del>emu</del> image at the bottom of it''s div:</h2>

Method #1:
<b>Relative Positioning</b>
<div style="border-style:solid;
border-width:5px;">
<img style="border:5px solid #6e5813;position:relative; bottom:-38px;" src="/static/2011/11/emma-emu-3.png" alt="Emma the Emu" title="emma-emu-3" width="146" height="149" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-461" /></div>
<br/>
<p>The HTML:</p>
<pre lang="html"><div id="container"
border-width:5px;>
<img id="emu" src="#your-image-source" alt="Emma the Emu" title="emma-emu-3">
</div>
</pre>
<p>The CSS:</p>
<pre lang="css">
#emu{
position:relative;
bottom:-38px;
}
</pre>
This approach is the simplest; I simply set the img position to "relative" and moved it 38 px below the "bottom". (-38px)  If I wanted the img to sit squarely on the "bottom", I would change -38 to 0 in the CSS.
This is fine, but what if you want control over the size of the containing div as well?  What if we don''t want that big space that gets left above the emu when it''s repositioned with "relative"?  In that case, you may want to play around with absolute-within-relative positioning.


Method #2:
<b>Absolute-Within-Relative Positioning</b>

<div style="border-style:solid;
border-width:5px;position:relative;">

<img style="border:5px solid #6e5813;position:absolute;bottom:-36px;" src="/static/2011/11/emma-emu-3.png" alt="Emma the Emu" title="emma-emu-3" width="146" height="149" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-461" />

<p style="margin-left:200px;"> This method causes the div to collapse.  Absolute and Float positioning both take elements out of the normal "flow" of the layout.  Without this text-plus-margin inside, the div will collapse and the emu will overlap other elements in the layout. Believe me. </p></div>
<br/>
<p>The HTML:</p>
<pre lang="html"><div id="container"
border-width:5px;">
<img id="emu" src="#your-image-source" alt="Emma the Emu" title="emma-emu-3">
<p> This is the text that gives your div some height, and keeps it from collapsing!</p>
</div>
</pre>
<p>The CSS:</p>
<pre lang="css">
#container{
position:relative;
}
#emu{
position:absolute;
bottom:-36px;
}
</pre>
This method has three key parts: setting the containing div to "relative", moving the img around with "absolute", and adding some other content to the containing div to give it height.  Miss any of the three elements, and your emu will probably go flying.

I think of this as the "sticker" method.  Whatever you''re positioning with absolute-within-relative becomes a "sticker", and you can stick it anywhere in relation to the main (default-positioned) content of the div.  Like a sticker, it will overlap other elements rather than creating a space of it''s own in the layout.  


<h2>Whew!</h2>

Understanding CSS positioning was a gradual thing for me.  What a relief it was when I first began to understand!  I hope my explanation helps this piece click into place for you.

The first time I tried to bake cupcakes, I used a boxed "Betty Crocker" mix and somehow STILL managed to screw them up. I left out the eggs, substituted soy milk for dairy milk, and forgot to grease the muffin tin. The "cupcakes" that emerged from the oven were gooey little clumps which could only be removed from the pan with great difficulty.
At least the batter tasted good!
That was about 8 years ago. Today I am a Cupcake Queen, able to whip up a batch of great-tasting vegan mini-cupcakes in less than an hour.
How did this happen?
<strong>I never gave up baking cupcakes.</strong>

They''ll do whatever they have to without question. No price is too great to pay for success, up to and including their own life (and others''). Do not expect them to realize they might be better off letting it go, even if they can barely stand. If you''re ever kidnapped or lost with no hope of rescue, they''ll be the one who will find you.

I never set out to become "that girl who bakes cupcakes". It has taken years of occasional baking experiments, punctuated with unnumbered kitchen disasters, to reach my current level of baking enlightenment. I have been frustrated to tears by the burned, inedible results of some of my adventures.  And yet, I knew that baking, like anything, can be learned.  And recently, when thinking back to my initial attempts, I realized how far I have come.

<h2>Cupcakes</h2>
Last weekend I made a half-and-half batch of vegan mini-cupcakes: "Sexy Low-Fat Vanilla Cupcakes" with chocolate mousse frosting, (image at top of post), and Rosewater-Cream Cupcakes with vegan Rosewater-Buttercream frosting (image below). Mmmmmmm-MMM!
<a href="/static/2011/12/rose-cream-big.jpg"><img src="/static/2011/12/rose-cream-big.jpg" alt="rosewater-cream cupcakes" title="rose-cream-big" width="530" height="374" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-507" /></a>
The Low-Fat Vanilla Cupcake recipe was straight from "Vegan Cupcakes Take Over The World", by Moskowitz &amp; Romero. In an age when nearly any recipe can be found for free on the internet, few cookbooks worth paying for. For me, this one was worth owning. The slim text is a symphony of variations on the theme of "cupcake", in the key of delicious.  
The chocolate mousse was whipped up from a boxed mix, and was only nearly-vegan. The reason I love it, however, is that it has a fraction of the calories in buttercream frosting! To clarify: My typical lunch has 500 calories or so. A single tablespoon of buttercream frosting, according to <s><a title="livestrong: calories in buttercream frosting" href="http://www.livestrong.com/thedailyplate/nutrition-calories/food/generic/butter-cream-frosting/">livestrong.com</a></s>, has 353 calories. (Link outdated) Chocolate-mousse, on the other hand, has only about 10 calories per tablespoonful.

(<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scjn/3586487445/sizes/m/in/photostream/" title="rose image on flickr">rose icon from Candie_N</a> on flickr)
I was both curious and nervous about creating a rose-flavored treat. I mean, what would a rose taste like? I''m so glad that I did try it, because <strong>rosewater cupcakes are delicious!</strong> I tweaked the "Pistachio Rosewater Cupcakes" recipe from "Vegan Cupcakes Take Over The World" by skipping the pistachios &amp; cardamom and using "Artificial Rosewater Flavoring" instead of authentic rosewater. I call them "Rosewater-Cream" because of the frosting, and because I may fill them with cream in a future iteration.
For the frosting I used the "Vegan Fluffy Buttercream Frosting" recipe, (again in "V.C.T.O.T.W."), substituting the rosewater flavoring instead of vanilla extract. It was almost too strong, but in the end I think the flavor was just enough.
I must say, I very much preferred the rose flavour to the vanilla. Why don''t people use rose more often when flavoring treats?

    '<h2>How to get my recipe to show up in Google''s "Recipe Search"?</h2>

There are a few tags that can be added to any recipe blog post to improve it''s appearance in google results, and to help the recipe show up in Google''s dedicated <a href="http://www.google.com/landing/recipes/" title="Google Recipe Search">Recipe Search</a>.   "SEO", or Search Engine Optimization, is the process of including this information to help search engines find your blog or website.

<!--more-->

<h2>Basic SEO for Recipes</h2>
The first step is to add tags to identify the title, picture (if any), and time required for your recipe.  Use this format, filling in the information from your recipe where I have put items in <strong>bold</strong> and ALL-CAPS.
<pre>
&lt;div itemscope itemtype="http://www.schema.org/Recipe"&gt;
&lt;h2 itemprop="name"&gt;<strong>RECIPE TITLE</strong>&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img itemprop="image" src="<strong>SOURCE OF YOUR IMAGE</strong>"/&gt;
&lt;p itemprop="totalTime" content="<strong>SEE NOTE ABOUT USING ISO 8601</strong>"&gt; <strong>YOUR RECIPE TIME HERE</strong>&lt;/p&gt;
<strong>...THE REST OF YOUR RECIPE...</strong>
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!---end recipe div---&gt;
</pre>

<h2>Using ISO 8601 Format</h2>
There is a specific format used for the value of ''content'' for any duration of time in microformats.  It must be formatted in the following way:
PT#H*M
Replace the # sign with the number of hours, and the * sign with the number of minutes.
Examples:
<ul>
<li>To write 1 hour and 30 minutes: PT1H30M</li>
<li>To write 20 minutes: PT20M</li>
<li>To write 2 hours: PT2H</li>
</ul>


<h2>Prepping your Recipe for Google''s Recipe Search</h2>
Google''s "Recipe Search" uses rich snippets to find recipes and sort them based on more factors than the title and cook-time.  To add more details to your recipe mark-up requires an understanding of HTML and the use of either RDFa, microdata, or microformats.
For those who don''t care to write a lot of technical mark-up in their recipe blog posts, Allison Day has created a <a href=" http://sushiday.com/recipe-seo-plugin/" title="Recipe SEO Plugin">Recipe SEO Plugin</a>.  Another option, for those using WP.com or other blogging platforms, is to use Allison''s <a href="http://recipeseo.com/" title="Recipe SEO Application">Recipe SEO Web-App</a> to generate the microformats for your recipe.

Of course, the joy in life often comes from learning new things.  If you want to try out some actual microdata in your post, here is the model I used in my <a href="http://flarnie.com/2011/personal/rose-cream-cupcake-recipe-vegan/" title="Rose “Cream” Cupcake Recipe (Vegan!)">previous post</a>:
<pre>
&lt;div itemscope itemtype="http://www.schema.org/Recipe"&gt;
&lt;a href="<strong>IMAGE SOURCE</strong>"&gt;&lt;img itemprop="image" src="<strong>IMAGE SOURCE</strong>" alt="<strong>ALT TEXT</strong>"/>&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p itemprop="description"&gt;<strong>DESCRIPTION OF RECIPE</strong>&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 itemprop="name"&gt;<strong>RECIPE TITLE</strong>&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table border="1"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preparation Time:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td itemprop="prepTime" content="<strong>ISO 8601 FORMAT TIME</strong>"&gt;<strong>PREP TIME</strong>&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bake Time:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td itemprop="cookTime" content="<strong>ISO 8601 FORMAT TIME</strong>"&gt;<strong>BAKE OR COOK TIME</strong>&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Makes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td itemprop="recipeYield"&gt;<strong>AMOUT YIELDED BY RECIPE</strong>&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li itemprop="ingredients"&gt;<strong>INGREDIENT 1</strong>&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li itemprop="ingredients"&gt;<strong>INGREDIENT 2</strong>&lt;/li&gt;
<strong>INGREDIENT 3 AND ONWARD IN SAME FORMAT...</strong>
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Directions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li itemprop="recipeInstructions"&gt;<strong>STEP 1 INSTRUCTION</strong>&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li itemprop="recipeInstructions"&gt;<strong>STEP 2 INSTRUCTION</strong>&lt;/li&gt;
<strong>STEP 3 AND ONWARD IN SAME FORMAT...</strong>
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!---end recipe div---&gt;

Soumabha and Manoj have given me the wonderful chance to share my experience of <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/insidetheinternet" title="Internet History, Technology, and Security, on Coursera">Internet History, Technology, and Security</a>, one of the free classes available on <a href="http://coursera.org">Coursera</a>.  This course provides an accessible overview of the history and workings of the world wide web.  Guiding this tour of the web is Professor Charles Severance, a.k.a. <a href="http://www.dr-chuck.com/" title="Charles Severance''s Home Page">"Dr. Chuck"</a>, of the University of Michigan.

<h2>Half History, Half Technology, and a Hint of Security</h2>
<a href="/static/2012/10/coursera-internet-history-screenshot.jpg"><img src="/static/2012/10/coursera-internet-history-screenshot.jpg" alt="" title="coursera-internet-history-screenshot" width="500" height="359" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1472" /></a>
The first half of the course focused on the history of the internet and <abbr title="world wide web">WWW</abbr>, from the first computers created at Blechley Park to the present day.  The second half of the course covered the specific technologies that are used in today''s internet.  One lecture dealt with the topic of internet security, but overall this was treated as a minor topic.
In the section on internet history, the use of interviews and documentary footage brought the history to life.  I got to hear first hand from people like Robert Cailliau, Jeff Bezos, and Brendan Eich, who were actually involved in the history of the internet.  
I also appreciated the clear explanations of technical concepts.  In the sections dealing with technology, the professor revisited core concepts to reinforce the information.  He also usually provided diagrams or visual aids during the lecture.  Knowing some basics about how the internet works is valuable for everyone in today''s technology saturated world. 
<q>Technology is for everybody, and that means everybody.</q> 
-Dr. Chuck, Grand Finale Lecture   

<h2>A Class for Everyone</h2>
I found this course very accessible, and I have no formal background in computer science or information technology.  The lectures were easy to understand, and technical terms were always explained.  The information seemed oriented towards the needs of the average internet user.  
Progress in the course was dependant on the weekly quizes and a final exam.  The questions were straightforward, and multiple attempts were allowed for the quizes.  The advertised time commitment of 3-5 hours per week was accurate; I spent about 3 hours per week watching the lectures, and completing the extra-credit writing assignments would have brought it up to 5.  
The professor and many volunteers put in extra effort to make the course accessible.  All of the lectures featured closed captions, and many also had subtitled translations created by volunteers.  Translations were completed in over 22 languages, with Spanish and Italian being by far the most commonly offered. Nearly all the lectures had Spanish subtitles available, and in his final summary lecture Dr. Chuck closed with a "Thank You" letter written by a Spanish speaking student.  The range of reported locations for students in the course was quite impressive:
<a href="/static/2012/10/IHTS_students_map.jpg"><img src="/static/2012/10/IHTS_students_map.jpg" alt="" title="IHTS_students_map" width="500" height="256" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1474" /></a>

<h2>Optional Writing Assignments</h2>  
Accomodating non-English speaking students was one reason that Dr. Chuck decided to make the writing assignments extra credit.  Initially the peer-reviewed writing assignments were a required component of the coursework, but the first writing assignment was followed by a sharp drop in enrollment and numerous complaints.
<a href="/static/2012/10/IHTS_enrollment_graph.jpg"><img src="/static/2012/10/IHTS_enrollment_graph.jpg" alt="" title="IHTS_enrollment_graph" width="500" height="318" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1473" /></a>
Similar issues are described in <a href="http://bytesandbanter.blogspot.in/search/label/Guest%20Posts" title="Review of Coursera- Fantasy and Science Fiction: The Human Mind, Our Modern World">La Graciada''s review</a> of the Coursera course <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/fantasysf" title="Coursera Course: Fantasy and Science Fiction">Fantasy and Science Fiction: The Human Mind, Our Modern World</a>.  This may be an overall issue with the format of peer reviewed writing assignments on Coursera.
I like the approach of offering the writing component as extra credit: It allows those who are interested to practice their writing skills and explore the topics more deeply, but doesn''t penalize those who lack the time or language skills to do so.

<h2>Useful for Teachers</h2>
A bonus of this particular course is that the professor has released all of his slides under a Creative Commons license, and encourages teachers to use them.  Allowing the copying, remixing, and reuse of his teaching materials takes the concept of "open education" to another level.  The impact becomes wider than the initial group of Coursera students.  I would especially recommend Internet History, Technology, and Security to teachers as resource for improving or adding to their own knowledge base.

<h2>Just As Advertised</h2>
Overall, I found the course to be just was was advertised: in addition to teaching you the origins and workings of the internet, it communicates the excitement and wonder of this innovative technology.  The knowledge offered is practical and useful to the average netizen, and requires no background at all in the subject.  I would recommend this course to anyone.  Of course, I''m a technology nut, so don''t take my word for it!  Go check out the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/insidetheinternet" title="Internet History, Technology, and Security, on Coursera">course description</a> for yourself, and enjoy the many other courses offered on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>.

"I will make dinner, eat dinner, do the dishes, take out the trash, and wash my hands."

*making dinner*
*eating dinner*
*doing dishes*
*taking out the trash*
*washing my hands*

In this case, the order is important. I can''t eat dinner before making it, and if I do the dishes first then there will be more dishes to do after dinner.  If I take out the trash, I want to wash my hands right after, and not right before.

This is just how my mind usually works.

Josh''s mind is a queue-

He gets an idea, works on it for a bit, and then puts that on hold while he does another few things.

"I''m driving home, and I think I''ll listen to some music.  Oh, and maybe I''ll call my Mom back; I''ve been meaning to do that.  Hey, and now there is another call on the line- I''d better answer that and finish talking to my Mom later.  I can pick up some pizza on the way home too!"

*begins driving*
*adds music to the queue*
*begins calling Mom*
*switches to another call*
*getting pizza*
(queue is complete for now, begin closing queue items)
*finish getting pizza*
*finish the second call*
*finish talking to Mom*
*listen to music*
*finish driving*

We both function well enough in life, but sometimes our different ways of thinking conflict.  This is what happens:

Flarnie''s stack: 
1. Chop carrots **This is my current task, and I move down through the list**
2. Chop broccoli
3. Steam the carrots and broccoli

Josh''s queue:
1. Drive Home
2. Listen to Music 
3. Call Mom **This is his current task, and he moves up through the list**

Then, the following is added to Josh''s queue-

1. Drive Home
2. Listen to Music
3. Call Mom
4. Greet Flarnie **Current task**

But for me, the item is at the bottom of my stack-

1. Chop carrots **Current Task**
2. Chop broccoli
3. Steam the carrots and broccoli
4. Greet Josh

Basically, sometimes we both need to be flexible.  I have learned to pause my ''current task'' and skip to the bottom of the stack.',

This historical decision will be made, for better or worse, in the very near future. 
And it <b>will affect you</b> no matter who you are:
Teachers, students, musicians, artists, gamers, developers/IT folks, activists, journalists, parents, bloggers, and anyone else who uses the internet!

<h2>How will SOPA affect the:</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Average person</b>- Do you watch funny videos on youtube?  Do you read wikipedia?  Do you share pictures on facebook and flickr?  Under SOPA/PIPA, these websites would be shut down or transformed into limited, highly-censored clones.  And <b>no new sites will be able to form around the idea of user-generated content</b>.  You''ll miss out on what would have been the next facebook, youtube, or wikipedia.</li>
Is this you?  Then <a href="#take-action">take action</a>!

<li><b>Blogger</b>- Do you post copyrighted material?  <b>It doesn''t matter</b>.  If anyone on your blogging platform is flagged, the entire site can be taken down.  If even one of your posts is accused of a copyright violation, your site will be blocked without due process.  Don''t think they would go that far?  These are people that have <a href="http://betanews.com/2003/09/09/riaa-sues-261-including-12-year-old-girl/" title="RIAA sues 261 including little girl">sued a 12 year old girl over copyright</a>.</li>
Is this you?  Then <a href="#take-action">take action</a>!

<li><b>Students</b>- No more wikipedia, and few or no blogs, for finding facts and resources.  No more Facebook for chatting about homework and networking.  And Google will be forced to feed you censored search results, just like in China.</li>
Is this you?  Then <a href="#take-action">take action</a>!

<li><b>Teachers</b>- No more free lesson plans online from great sites like teachers.net, and no more craft projects from great sites like cutoutandkeep.net.  No more learning new things from wikipedia and wikihow, and no more blogging about teaching and learning!  </li>
Is this you?  Then <a href="#take-action">take action</a>!

<li><b>Gamers</b>- No more gaming forums, and no more sharing gaming videos, screenshots, fan art, or memes related to your favorite games.  Development of new games and new gaming platforms will likely be stifled, along with all other types of tech. innovation!</li>
Is this you?  Then <a href="#take-action">take action</a>!

<li><b>Artists</b>- No more online art galleries, including deviantart!  No more posting fan-art or remixed videos, no more posting your photos on flickr, and no more selling your work on etsy.</li>
Is this you?  Then <a href="#take-action">take action</a>!

<li><b>Musicians</b>- Have you ever done a cover?  No more posting them on youtube.com, and no more enjoying music videos or remixed music on youtube.com either!</li>
Is this you?  Then <a href="#take-action">take action</a>!

<li><b>IT/Developers</b>- Fewer jobs, more censorship.  Need I say more?</li>
Is this you?  Then <a href="#take-action">take action</a>!

<li><b>Activists</b>-Free speech is vital to any kind of political action.  A system allowing government censorship of sites like facebook and twitter is a recipe for political censorship, even if the proposed target is copyright infringement.  Posting government documents, info about fair use and protected speech, and use of "copyrighted" political images or photos would all lead to a site being blocked.  For a really silly example of this, read about how <a href="http://www.geekosystem.com/anti-sopa-petition-whitehouse/" title="SOPA would take down whitehouse.gov">SOPA would technically lead to blocking of whitehouse.gov</a>.</li>
Is this you?  Then <a href="#take-action">take action</a>!

<li><b>Journalists</b>-See above, and also expect far greater difficulty in writing anything about popular culture or media.  Using images, text, or screenshots from a movie or game in your review could lead to the entire news site being blocked!</li>
Is this you?  Then <a href="#take-action">take action</a>!

<li><b>Parents</b>-   Your children will grow up with a censored internet; a system of governmental control much like the ones used in China and Iran.  Your parenting-blog could be shut down if anyone flags it as breaking copyright law, regardless of evidence.  Do you hope to see pictures of your grandkids on facebook?  Think again; facebook (as it is) cannot exist under SOPA/PIPA.</li>
Is this you?  Then <a href="#take-action">take action</a>!
</ul>

<h2>Why will SOPA/PIPA cause all this chaos?</h2>
The leaders of the tech industry summed it up well in an <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-57342914-281/silicon-valley-execs-blast-sopa-in-open-letter/" title="silicon valley execs blast sopa in an open letter">open letter</a>:
<blockquote>
<p>"These two pieces of legislation threaten to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Require web services, like the ones we helped found, to monitor what users link to, or upload. This would have a chilling effect on innovation; *</li>
<li>Deny website owners the right to due process of law;</li>
<li>Give the U.S. Government the power to censor the web using techniques similar to those used by China, Malaysia and Iran; and </li>
<li>Undermine security online by changing the basic structure of the Internet."</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
*(Meaning sites that rely on user-generated and user-submitted content may sink beneath the task of censoring every piece of information that is submitted.  If one page on their site is found in violation of copyright, then their whole site may be taken down.  So, in other words, no more wikipedia, youtube, etsy, facebook, twitter, ebay, linkedin, deviantart, teachers.net, wikihow.com, cutoutandkeep.net, and more.  At the very least, expect to see large portions of content blocked from these and similar sites.  The worst damage will hit start-ups and new sites, effectively stopping innovation.)

    'I just have to rant for a moment about my . . . adventure with trying to add a new widget area to a WordPress theme.

<!--more-->

So, I''m currently working on a custom WP theme for my Sweetie. I want it to be PERFECT. And I am using this project as an excuse to really roll my sleeves up and get started learning about the WP API, and digging into PHP while I''m at it.

I started with two widget areas, and easily added a third using the approach outlined in <a title="Adding a Sidebar in WordPress" href="http://justintadlock.com/archives/2010/11/08/sidebars-in-wordpress">Justin Tadlock''s Tutorial</a>. After fiddling around with some other parts of the theme, I wanted to quickly add a fourth widget area in the footer.

I followed the same steps to add a fourth widget but . . . Nothing happened. The widget area didn''t appear on the dashboard or on the theme; not even in the rendered HTML code.

I tried renaming IDs and classes, thinking I had accidentally caused a conflict. I tried googling around, reading about issues folks have had with the dynamic_sidebar() function... Nothing had much of an effect. Actually, nothing had any effect.

After spending most of the afternoon on this problem, I gave up for the day, vowing to regroup and attack the problem in the morning.

I awoke with a fierce commitment to try EVEN HARDER and read everything I could find, and to post my problem on stack exchange if I couldn''t find the solution by lunch time.

The morning dragged on; again, nothing worked. I tried variations of every factor, testing each part as I went. According to everything I had read and seen it should have worked, but it didn''t. As lunch approached, I started writing up an explanation of the problem to post on stack exchange.  On a whim I then tried adding a small feature to the existing widget areas. I added the ''description'' attribute, which is new since WP 2.9.

And again, it didn''t show up. Nothing changed.

That''s when I knew something was up.  The simplest adjustment didn''t work, so there was something amiss OUTSIDE of my code.  Why didn''t I think of that before?

I checked and double-checked the files through the ''editor'' on the WP dashboard, and the changes I tried to make were not reflected in the website or the rendered HTML.

Next I opened up FTP and looked at the files on the server.

<strong>None of the changes I had been making were saved on the server.</strong>

Somehow during the previous day, the read/write permissions on the server had been changed. (Don''t ask me how, at this point I''m just glad I figured it out and got it fixed!)

With the permissions fixed, I was able to add the fourth widget area in 20 minutes!  It took no time at all now that I have MEMORIZED EVERY DARN THING about widget-area-implementation in WP 3.0.

Well.

From this I learned three things:
<ul>
	<li>Don''t always assume you are doing something wrong.</li>
	<li>If something doesn''t work, try the most basic test-case possible.</li>
	<li>It''s probably best to edit theme files locally and use FTP to upload them, rather than relying on the ''editor'' on the dashboard. (Although the ''editor'' IS super-handy!)</li>

Comparisons have been made between the US and China, and I was curious: Just what is the "Great Firewall of China"?
The “Great Firewall of China” refers to government censorship of electronic communication in China. This includes monitoring and censoring user-generated content, websites, emails, and texts. People have been locked up for sending a text or email. Scary, right?
<!--more-->
<h2>The Great Firewall of China</h2>
<strong>What:</strong> Criminalization of dissent, complaint, and whistle-blowing. Sharing information over the Internet becomes a privilege rather than a right. The "Firewall" refers to the measures used to enforce these restrictive laws.
An example from one of the first of many Internet regulations in China:
<blockquote>”Article 5.

No unit or individual may use the Internet to create, replicate, retrieve, or transmit the following kinds of information:
(1) Inciting to resist or breaking the Constitution or laws or the implementation of administrative regulations;

(2) Inciting to overthrow the government or the socialist system;

(3) Inciting division of the country, harming national unification;

(4) Inciting hatred or discrimination among nationalities or harming the unity of the nationalities;

(5) Making falsehoods or distorting the truth, spreading rumors, destroying the order of society;

(6) Promoting feudal superstitions, sexually suggestive material, gambling, violence, murder;

(7) Terrorism or inciting others to criminal activity; openly insulting other people or distorting the truth to slander people;

(8) Injuring the reputation of state organs;

(9) Other activities against the Constitution, laws or administrative regulations. “</blockquote>
from <a title="1997 Regulation of Internet in China" href="http://www.lehmanlaw.com/resource-centre/laws-and-regulations/information-technology/computer-information-network-and-internet-security-protection-and-management-regulations-1997.html">Computer Information Network and Internet Security, Protection and Management Regulations</a> - 1997
(Approved by the State Council on December 11, 1997 and promulgated by the Ministry of Public Security on December 30, 1997)

<h2>How are these laws enforced?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The “Golden Shield”, a government-run firewall system that blocks some websites from reaching ISPs in China.</li>
	<li>Skype and similar services (in China) block blacklisted words, including “dalai lama” and “freedom”.</li>
	<li>Search engines block and filter results.</li>
	<li>Websites employ censorship teams to read and delete/ban posts and content that may cause trouble.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The SOPA &amp; PIPA Connection</h2>
A <a title="Firewall Law Could Infringe On Free Speech" href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCMQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2011%2F11%2F16%2Fopinion%2Ffirewall-law-could-infringe-on-free-speech.html&amp;ei=gw4jT9-7NafL0QGwjq38CA&amp;usg=AFQjCNG9pRAuei3wxf2YQ4NJaKiifKtJCw">NY Times Opinion piece</a> summed up the comparison well:
“The intention is not the same as China’s Great Firewall, a nationwide system of Web censorship, but the practical effect could be similar.”
If passed, SOPA and PIPA would move US law closer to the system used in China. The blocking of infringing sites and content, by ISPs, search engines, and host sites, would be the only way for those laws to be enforced. Effective censoring and blocking of all copyright infringment on the internet would likely require a US equivalent to the “Golden Shield”. At that point the methods used would match my summary of the censorship methods used in China, and the slippery slope from IP enforcement to political censorship is troubling to consider.
<h2>A Tall And Tattered Wall</h2>
Interestingly, the “Great Firewall of China” has been described as both pervasive and easy to bypass. The ''Wall'' certainly has an effect, but it''s also ineffective in many cases. I think the following experiment speaks well to that duality:
<h2>What Is Blocked In China?</h2>
I used <a title="test websites to see if censored in China" href="http://www.greatfirewallofchina.org">greatfirewallofchina.org</a> to test urls for availability in China (as of Jan. 18th, 2012). Sure enough, many sites were blocked, and yet sites like 4chan.org, wikipedia, craigslist, and the NY Times were available. Is this because they really AREN''T WORRIED about the influence of 4chan? Is the government unable to keep up with the development of sites that may present problems? The whole thing seems really confusing to me.

Here were my more interesting results-
China blocks:
<ul>
	<li>google.com</li>
	<li>youtube.com</li>
	<li>http://news.bbc.co.uk</li>
	<li>twitter.com</li>
	<li>facebook.com</li>
	<li><a title="Tiananmnen Square, 1989; The Declassified History" href="http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB16/">Tiananmnen Square, 1989; The Declassified History</a></li>
	<li>amnesty.org (Amnesty International)</li>
</ul>
I was surprised that these passed:
<ul>
	<li>theonion.com</li>
	<li>4chan.org</li>
	<li>craigslist.com</li>
	<li>boingboing.net</li>
	<li>wikipedia.org</li>
	<li>nytimes.com</li>
	<li>last.fm and punkrock.org (you''d think they''d be more worried about the power of music!)</li>
	<li>dalailama.com</li>
	<li>greatfirewallofchina.org (at least they can see what they''re missing!)</li>
</ul>
I have no doubt that losing access to your site or a site you love is a terrible thing. I also have no doubt that as soon as the government generates their “block” list, new sites emerge that produce the same type of content and opportunities found on “blocked” sites. It seems that with censorship, both sides lose!
And if this bothers you, you''re not alone.

    'What are skip links, and why do web designers choose to hide them?
Long lists of links (like those usually featured in a navigation menu) can be time-consuming or confusing for some users to navigate.  Any folks using a screen-reader, keyboard, or other non-mouse interface to browse the internet can benefit from the inclusion of a “Skip Link”, which allows them to skip past the long menu of navigation or other links.  In some cases, having a “Skip Link” on your website can be a legal necessity.
(For state and federal government websites in the US, accessibility is a legal issue under section 508 of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Reference: <a href=" http://www.ada.gov/websites2.htm" title="ADA.gov">ada.gov</a> )

Skip links contribute to accessability on a website, just like ramps contribute to accessibility in architecture.  Ramps can be beautiful in architecture and design.  Why don''t we see more beautifully incorporated ''skip links'' on websites?

And, why is it common practice to hide Skip Links?

<!--more-->
<h2>Why Hide Skip Links?</h2>
There are two sides to every issue.  Here are some of the reasons for either showing or hiding skip links:
<table border="1">
<tr>
<td><b>Why Hide It?</b></td>
<td><b>Why Show It?</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>May confuse some users. (''Hey, what''s a skip-link?'')</td>
<td>Raises awareness of accessibility issues on the web.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Not everyone needs them. (''Let''s ignore minorities!'')</td>
<td>The link will be available and useful to <b>everyone</b> who wants or needs it. (Good Usability.)</td>

<tr>
<td>They take up space.</td>

</tr>
</table> 
**There is some indication that users are able to rely on headings for navigation, rather than skip links.  A survey found that 35.3% of  people using screen-readers “Seldom” or “Never” used “''Skip'' Links”.
(reference: <a href="http://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey3/#skip" title="Web Aim Screen Reader Survey">WebAim''s Screen Reader Survey</a> )
It''s also well known that Skip Links are a “user agent issue”, and that eventually user agents will be expected to take care of this functionality, meaning developers won''t have to worry about Skip Links any more. (reference <a href="http://accessites.org/site/2006/05/skip-link-pros-and-cons/" title="accessites.org: skip link pros and cons">Skip Link Pros and Cons</a>, from Acesssites.com )

<h2>Methods of Hiding & The Problems Created</h2>

<b>Method 1:</b> display: none
<ul><li>screen-readers generally don''t read this (reference  <a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/201108/do_not_use_displaynone_to_visually_hide_content_intended_for_screen_readers/" title="Do No Use Display None~... from 456 Berea St.">Do No Use Display None to Visually Hide Content Intended For Screen Readers</a>, from 456 Berea St.  ) </li></ul>

<b>Method 2:</b> off-screen
<ul><li>I found issues with this method and mobile phones; the user can pan to the “off-screen” area, and various methods of disabling scrolling either limit the user too much or don''t work at all.</li>
<li>some screen readers don''t pick this up (reference <a href="http://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/hiding-content-for-accessibility" title="Hiding Content For Accessibility, from Snook.ca">Hiding Content For Accessibility</a>, from Snook.ca) </li>
<li>users who can see and are navigating with a keyboard may miss the skip-link (reference <a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200909/skip_links_need_to_be_at_least_temporarily_visible/" title="Skip Links Need To Be At Least Temporarily Visible">Skip Links Need To Be ..Temporarily Visible</a>, from 456 Berea St. )</li>
</ul>

<b>Method 3:</b> clipping
<ul><li>may cause a ''jump'' in the focus depending on placement</li>
<li>might cause issues with fluid layouts, since this technique relies on pixel-based measurements</li>
<li>again, users who can see and navigate with a keyboard may miss the skip-link (reference <a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200909/skip_links_need_to_be_at_least_temporarily_visible/" title="Skip Links Need To Be Temp.

Much has happened since the massive online protests against SOPA and PIPA on Weds. Jan. 18th.  My very own Senator <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2012/01/18/marco_rubio_flips_against_pipa.html">Marco Rubio withdrew his support of PIPA</a>, and <a href="http://themoderatevoice.com/135542/breaking-reid-tables-pipa-smith-tables-sopa/">SOPA and PIPA have both been tabled for the moment</a>.  Yet, the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, aka ACTA, poses the same dangers as SOPA and PIPA on an international scope.  Most disturbingly of all, the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/24/us-megaupload-impact-idUSTRE80N03J20120124" title="megaupload takedown unlikely to deter piracy">recent shutting down of megaupload.com</a>  was done without SOPA, PIPA, or ACTA.  
<!--more-->

<h2>SOPA and PIPA Only Delayed</h2>

On Jan. 20th Chairman Smith issued <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/news/01202012.html" title="Smith delays PIPA">a statement</a> regarding SOPA, along with the announcement that 
<blockquote>"The House Judiciary Committee will postpone consideration of the legislation until there is wider agreement on a solution."</blockquote>  
In other words, SOPA is withdrawn, but it could return.  
PIPA is another story; despite a delay, Senator Reid has expressed the hope that "we can reach a compromise in the coming weeks." <a href="http://democrats.senate.gov/2012/01/20/reid-statement-on-intellectual-property-bill/" title="Reid Statement on PIPA"></a>  In other words, PIPA is being renegotiated and will be back.
It is no less urgent now than last week that those who care about a free internet contact their representatives.  Here are a few updated links for ways to take action:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://americancensorship.org/#take-action" title="write to congress">Write to congress about PIPA!</a></li>
<li><s><a href="https://www.google.com/landing/takeaction/" title="thank congress for delaying SOPA/PIPA">Thank congress for delaying SOPA/PIPA</a></s>, from google.com.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/acta" title="ACTA Info">Read about ACTA</a>, an international agreement with similar provisions to SOPA/PIPA.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What is ACTA?</h2>
To summarize some of what is floating around the internet about ACTA:
<ul>  
<li>ACTA is a trade agreement, not a law.  It would not create laws, but would lock the US and other countries into the strictest of our current copyright laws.</li>
<li>ACTA mistakes copying data for physical counterfeit of objects.</li>
<li>ACTA would classify any technology/website that allows or "induces" copying as criminal, rather than simply punishing the act of copying itself.  Under these definitions, a VCR could be considered a criminal technology.</li>
<li>ACTA could strengthen patents on medicine, leading to shortages of life-saving drugs when countries and people can''t pay for the name-brand version of a drug.  Provisions for producing generic drugs in the case of outbreak or plague would no longer apply.</li>
<li>It''s not really clear what ACTA is, and how it will be interpreted.  Is it a binding treaty, or simply a standard to strive for?  When and how can it be broken, and what is the consequence?</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Attack on Megaupload.com</h2>
So, if we all pull together and stop bills and acts like SOPA, PIPA, and ACTA from passing, then you won''t have to worry about the government taking down sites because of things their users post.  Right?  You wouldn''t expect to find a takedown notice on a site like youtube, or flickr, or deviantart, right?

Wrong-O.  If you visit <strike><a href="http://megaupload.com/">megaupload.com</a></strike> at this time, that is exactly what you will find.
<strong>4/9/2013 EDIT: the above link now goes to an OpenDNS dead page, naturally.  Megaupload is really gone.</strong>
  Megaupload, like youtube or facebook, <strike>is</strike> was a site where some users shared copyrighted content and others shared legal content.  Megaupload was, (according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megaupload" title="wikipedia on Megaupload">wikipedia</a>), the 13th most visited site on the internet, with about 180,000,000 registered users.  With that many users, screening all content for copyright infringment is impossible.  
Should the government be able to take down sites like megaupload?  Should the owners of this site be put in jail?  Was megaupload harming or helping artists and musicians?
If you''re wondering what musicians and artists think of megaupload.com, watch the Mega Song: 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0Wvn-9BXVc
featuring the following artists and their approval of megaupload:
<ul><li>P Diddy</li>
<li>Kanye West</li>
<li>Chris Brown</li>
<li>Jamie Foxx</li>
<li>Kim Kardashian</li>
<li>Lil John</li>
<li>(The) Game</li>
<li>Floyd Mayweather</li>
<li>Serena Williams</li>
<li>Ciara</li>
<li>and Macy Gray</li>
</ul>

There is a great 60 second explanation of the amazing story of this song featured <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDT5oU8wljE&feature=fvst" title="the Mega Song Story in 60 seconds">here</a>.

<h2>Why was megaupload.com taken down?</h2>

I can''t speak to the legal complexities of why this particular site was targeted by the FBI.  It seems to me that the core issue was this: copyrighted content was being shared, that there is evidence that those running the site knew about this, and that they did nothing to stop or discourage it.  

How could those running the site possibly have known what each of their 180,000,000 users was sharing?  And how different is this site from youtube.com, where you can always find some copyrighted songs/movies/images despite the efforts of youtube to take such content down?  Nothing short of complete surveillance of the internet will be able to stop copyright infringement.  Shall we give away our privacy to keep the RIAA and the copyright laywers in business?

If you find the idea of a censored internet disturbing, I recommend receiving updates from <a href="https://www.eff.org/" title="Electronic Frontier Foundation">the Electronic Frontier Foudnation</a> (EFF), and <a href="http://demandprogress.org/" title="Demand Progress">Demand Progress</a>.

    'Adding Javascripts to a WordPress Theme requires the use of the wp_enqueue_script() function, awareness of the "no-conflict" mode of jQuery, and possibly localization. It''s much more complicated than adding Javascript to an old-fashioned, hand-coded HTML website!
<!--more-->
<h2>Using wp_enqueue_script()</h2>
Firstly, it''s worth reading the <a title="function reference: wp_enqueue_script" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_enqueue_script">documentation</a> on this function in the WP Codex. If you found that a bit confusing, follow along with my very specific example:
<ol>
	<li>Let''s say your script is called "my-script.js", and it uses the <a title="jQuery" href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> library. Upload the file to the server, putting it in your theme directory.</li>
	<li>Write the following somewhere in the &lt;head&gt; element of your header.php file:
<pre lang="PHP"><?php wp_enqueue_script(
      ''my-script'',
     get_template_directory_uri() . "/my-script.js",
    array(''jquery'')
);
?></pre>
Make sure to put it before &lt;?php wp_head();&gt;. (The wp_head() hook should always be the last thing inside the &lt;head&gt; element of a WP theme.)</li>
	<li>Remember to substitute the real name of your Javascript file for "my-script.js". If you put your file inside a folder called "js", then change the second argument to this:
<pre lang="PHP">     get_template_directory_uri() . "/js/my-script.js",</pre>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Lose the $</h2>
Your jquery-dependant script may be perfect in every way, but it still won''t run on WordPress if you''re using $ as a replacement for jquery. As the codex says,
"In "no-confict" mode, the $ shortcut is not available and the longer jQuery is used." In other words, run a search-and-replace on your code and change every $ into the word jQuery.
<h2>Localizing Your Script</h2>
If you''re localizing your theme, then you already know about <a title="I18N for WP Developers" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/I18n_for_WordPress_Developers">I18N for WordPress</a> and why it''s important. To tag text from your Javascript for translation, insert the following right after wp_enqueue_script() in the &lt;head&gt; element:
<pre lang="PHP">$l10n_obj = array(
    ''text1'' => __(''text1'', ''your-theme''),
    ''text2'' => __(''text2'', ''your-theme''),
    ''text3'' => __(''text3'', ''your-theme''),
    ''text4'' => __(''text4'', ''your-theme''),
    ''text5'' => __(''text5'', ''your-theme'')
);
wp_localize_script(''my-script'', ''my_l10n_obj'', $l10n_obj);</pre>
Fill in the bits of translatable text in place of ''text1'', ''text2'', etc., and your theme''s name instead of ''your-theme''.

Lastly, throw this function into your script:
<pre lang="PHP">     function response($error)
    {
        if ($error)
            alert(my_l10n_obj.response_error);
        else
            alert(my_l10n_obj.response_correct);
    }</pre>

More about how to localize your javascript in WordPress can be found <a title="WP script localization" href="http://betterwp.net/wordpress-tips/script-localization/comment-page-1/#comment-661">here</a>.

<h2>Troubleshooting and Debugging</h2>
If your script isn''t working there are several ways to find the problem. Firstly, you should check to if the problem lies within the script itself or elsewhere in your code.  Try commenting out everything except an alert wrapped in the document.ready function, like so:
<pre lang="javascript"> jQuery(document).ready(function(){

alert("I am an alert box!");
//commented-out-code...
    }; 
    //end the on-ready loop</pre>
Save and reload the website.  If the alert runs, then you know the problem is likely a typo within your script. If not, then your script isn''t running at all and there is a problem with the enqueueing or something else outside of your script.

I also highly recommend installing <a title="get firebug" href="http://getfirebug.com/">firebug</a>, a development and debugging tool from Mozilla. You can then see if your scripts are loading in the rendered html, and see any errors that occur when the page is loaded.

Lastly, viewing and editing the script in a text editor with syntax highlighting, rather than through the dashboard editor, can help you spot typos and bugs.

    'This week I finished two custom WordPress themes, and both are now online:

<h2>Sticker Scribbles WordPress Theme</h2>

Writing a fixed-width theme really is easier than the alternative.  It may not look snazzy on mobile, but it allows for fun things like a baseline grid.

<a href="/static/2012/02/screenshot.png"><img src="/static/2012/02/screenshot-1024x800.png" alt="screenshot of TIML blog" title="screenshot" width="640" height="500" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-729" /></a>

This was really a fun project, custom designed for the T.I.M.L. blog.  When originally setting up the blog, I was going to host it on wordpress.com and use a free theme, but none of the available themes had the necessary rude-girl aesthetic.  So I wrote my own theme.
What started as more or less a child theme became an excuse for me to write my own framework from the ground up.  (Mostly.)  Now it''s done, and for now I''m hosting the blog on my server; you can see it at <a href="http://flarnie.com/timl/">flarnie.com/timl</a>.

<h2>Pixel Perfection</h2>

I will likely let my perfectionism run rampant on these two themes for a little longer before submitting them to the themes directory.  I''ll be tied up for the next two weeks or so, but when the time is available these themes will be given the final once-over set free.  The idea of giving back to the WordPress community is very appealing to me; I hope to be making and sharing many more themes in the future.',

<h2>What''s this stuff about "CC" or "Creative Commons"?</h2>
<strong>Creativity</strong> is essential for progress, happiness, and beauty in our world.  
<i>What leads to more creativity?:</i>
(Wrong-O) <b>A.</b> Limiting artists from using certain ideas, images, sounds, or texts in their creative process.
(Ding-ding-ding!) <b>B.</b> Sharing and encouraging the use of all ideas, images, sounds, or texts as needed to make something new.
If you said ''B.'', then you are a visionary.  Instead of using copyright, which restricts the spreading of a work and, by extension, the audience of the creator, more and more creators are choosing a Creative Commons License (a.k.a CC).
Depending on which CC license you choose, you have control over who and how folks can use your work.  It gives creators more options rather than the blanket ban offered by copyright.

So you''re wanting to add some stylish ribbons to your web design, a la any of the <a href="http://www.web3mantra.com/2011/07/12/30-ribbons-in-web-design/" title="30+ Ribbons in Web Design">"30+ Ribbons in Web Design" posted at web3mantra.com</a>.  
Problem:  You also want a <strong>responsive web design</strong> with a liquid layout.  A ribbon usually requires an image, and images can wreak all kinds of havoc on a liquid layout.  How to mesh your desired accent images with a responsive design?  I used fluid images, making my simple graphics stretch and flow as needed.

<!--more-->

<h2>What is Responsive Design?</h2>
It all started with an article by Ethan Marcotte, writing for A List Apart in 2010.  In <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/" title="Responsive Design, by Ethan Marcotte on A List Apart">his article</a>, he proposed web designers adapt to the widening range of screen sizes and devices by using a mix of <a href="http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2009/06/02/fixed-vs-fluid-vs-elastic-layout-whats-the-right-one-for-you/" title="Fixed vs Fluid vs Elastic Layouts, from Smashing Magazine">liquid layouts</a>, <a href="http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2010/07/19/how-to-use-css3-media-queries-to-create-a-mobile-version-of-your-website/" title="Use CSS3 Media Queries to create a mobile version of your website">CSS3 media queries</a>, and fluid images to create "responsive" web designs.  The idea is a website with a layout that adapts to the screen size it is viewed at.
Fluid Images are images that change size to adjust to the screen size and the other fluid elements of the website.  Detailed images generally don''t resize well, and most images will look strange if their proportions change.  However, simple accents (like ribbons) look good even when resized.  For my "ribbon" wrap-arounds, I used simple vector triangles with a gradient.

<h2>How to create ribbons with responsive images</h2>
In just three steps:
<ol>
<li>First create a png image of your ribbon in an image editing program.  (You can use Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator, or for free try <a href="http://www.gimp.org/" title="the Gnu Image Manipulation Program (GIMP)">GIMP</a> or <a href="http://inkscape.org/" title="Inkscape Vector Graphics Program">Inkscape</a>.)</li>
<a href="/static/2012/03/ribbon-left.png"><img src="/static/2012/03/ribbon-left.png" alt="" title="ribbon-left" width="18" height="29" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-829" /></a><p>I created a png with a transparent background, measuring 18x29px.<p>
<p><b>Tip: </b>Everything on my blog is Creative Commons Attribution-Share-Alike licensed, so you can actually use this ribbon graphic if you want!  To recolor it, try colors>map>rotate colors in GIMP, or blending options>gradient overlay in Photoshop.</p>
<li>Use the image in your HTML, and position it with CSS.  I used absolute positioning within a relatively positioned div, a technique I wrote more about in a <a href="http://flarnie.com/2011/tutorial/position-a-div…containing-div/" title="how to position a div within it''s containing div.">previous entry</a>.</li>
<li>Assign width to the image using percent values, much like you would for divs and other elements in a typical liquid layout.  So long as the image has the correct height to begin with, it will become narrow or wide depending on the adjustments made to the total design. 
</li>
[caption id="attachment_832" align="alignnone" width="300" caption="The ribbons become narrow in this small-screen view of the website."]<a href="/static/2012/03/narrow-ribbon-screenshot.png"><img src="/static/2012/03/narrow-ribbon-screenshot-300x151.png" alt="" title="narrow-ribbon-screenshot" width="300" height="151" class="size-medium wp-image-832" /></a>[/caption]
</ol>

<h2>Screens Smaller Than 600px Wide</h2>
Even an adjustable fluid design will likely look strange at sizes below a certain point.  I recommend using CSS3 media queries to create separate styles for very small screens and mobile.  You can also <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_dim_min-width.asp" title="set min width with css, from W3 schools">set a minimum width</a> with css, meaning your images will only shrink so far and then stop at a set size.

Because of some confusion a genuine reader had about posting comments, I recently changed my settings to allow for unmoderated comments.  Initially only an occassional spam comment would appear, but last night 15 new spam comments appeared on one entry!
These comments initially seem valid, but on close examination the author and website listed are obviously commercial and the general comment is nothing but an excuse for a link-back.  I appreciate that the spammers have risen to using proper grammar and including only one link in their comments, but spam is spam, and it''s darn annoying!
So I''ve switched back to comment moderation, meaning comments will not appear until I happen to log on and click "approve".
<strong>Please feel free to leave comments that are relevant!</strong>  And linking to your site is fine, but I hope that it shows you are an actual person and not a spam-bot or an SEO creep.

    'Since the massive protests in response to SOPA and PIPA, I have been keeping track of proposed tech-related laws in anticipation of SOPA clone.  A number of bills have been proposed recently, and I was wondering if any of them represents a serious threat to the internet as we know it.
The good news is that SOPA and PIPA had an effect: lawmakers are listening.  They have clearly tailored their proposed legislation in ways that focus on "cybersecurity" rather than copyright, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2012/02/senate-cybersecurity-bill.ars" title="Senate Cybersec Bill Leaves Internet And Tech Industry Alone, from Ars Technica">leaving the structure of the internet and the tech industry alone</a> as much as possible.

Potential internet wiretapping and SOPA-like clauses?  Yes, these bills are still scary, but they represent a step away from copyright-policing and a genuine effort at dealing with cybersecurity issues.  It will be interesting to see which proposed version wins out, and how the public reacts.

Making a completely free game is an extreme example of sharing great things with your users.  Another way of sharing is by actually giving away some portion of your product, and this can take any number of forms.

I remember as a kid, back when my allowance was a couple dollars per week, free games were my main option for entertainment.  I downloaded the <a href="http://www.spiderwebsoftware.com/productsOld.html" title="Exile and Older Games, from Spiderweb Software">Exile series</a> and promptly poured hours into the demo portion of each game.  Eventually, after much begging and whining, my parents were willing to fork over the modest sum to unlock the rest of the games.  Their business model worked then, and I still have great respect for their company.

This effectively creates pro bono service for small businesses, while also allowing larger businesses to taste-test before buying in bulk.  Smart! 
 
One could argue that the "huge free demo" is really just a sneaky way to get users hooked.  Yet, in both of the above cases I as a user didn''t feel like I was being hoodwinked or tricked.  I like that they are very clear about what they are offering: a huge free demo, with no hidden costs, and the possibility of purchasing more of the product if you like it.

A friend of mine is a fan of <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/" title="Sparkfun">Sparkfun</a>, a company that sells electronic parts online and connects with users in all kinds of cool ways.  This small company offers free classes and tutorials, as well as various events during the year.  In addition to their involvement with <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/static/about" title="Sparkfun About- Events">Maker Faires and Robotics Competitions</a>, they actually held a <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/news/781" title="Sparkfun Free Day 2012">"Free Day"</a> this year, giving away 200,000$ worth of electronic components and supplies.  Talk about sharing!

Of course, a company can''t earn my trust just by giving away merchandise.  My friend pointed out <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/static/about" title="Sparkfun takes public stance against SOPA">Sparkfun''s public stance against SOPA</a> during the controversy about the bill; this type of action in the name of user''s interest is what really shows a company''s true colors.

    'Is the CISPA (Cyber Intelligence Security and Protection Act) Bill, sponsored by Michael Rogers (R MI) a threat to the Internet as we know it?
Yes.

Does it present the same type of threat as the SOPA and PIPA bills?  Not exactly.

<small>(For resources on fighting the passage of this bill, skip to the bottom.)</small>

I''m reposting an infographic by <a href="http://luminconsulting.com/" title="Lumin Consulting">Lumin Consulting</a> that explains the issue much better and faster than I would:

Here are the screenshots broken up, with the text written out:

<h2>Welcome to the Cute Emu Tutorial:</h2>
<ol><li> 

You should already have the cute emu face from <a href="http://flarnie.com/2012/tutorial/cute-inkscape-tutorial-series-kawaii-emu-part-1/" title="Cute Inkscape Tutorial Series: Kawaii Emu part 1">the previous tutorial</a>.</li>
<li>Use the circle tool to draw a body and the line tool to sketch the neck and one leg.
<a href="/static/2012/04/emu-tut-step-one.png"><img src="/static/2012/04/emu-tut-step-one-300x222.png" alt="" title="emu tut step one" width="300" height="222" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-951" /></a>
</li>
(Don''t worry about colors or details until the end.)
<li>To create the bumpy feathered shape of the body, draw a spike at each place you want a bump, using the line tool again.
The goal is to put a node (the points where the straight lines meet) on either side of the places you will want curves.
<a href="/static/2012/04/emu-tut-step-three.png"><img src="/static/2012/04/emu-tut-step-three-300x209.png" alt="" title="emu tut step three" width="300" height="209" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-952" /></a>
</li>
<li>Here is where we add curves, using the ''edit paths by node'' tool on the top left.
You can now see why we place nodes on either side of a curve.
<a href="/static/2012/04/emu-tut-step-four.png"><img src="/static/2012/04/emu-tut-step-four-300x246.png" alt="" title="emu tut step four" width="300" height="246" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-953" /></a>

Notice that the feather curves are a bit more complex than the neck.
On top of each feather-curve is a node with handles open 180 degrees, while the inner node handles are nearly closed, with a very small angle.
<a href="/static/2012/04/emu-tut-step-four-and-half.png"><img src="/static/2012/04/emu-tut-step-four-and-half-300x244.png" alt="" title="emu tut step four and half" width="300" height="244" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-954" /></a>
</li>
(Note: I use the zoom tool at various points throughout this to see details.)
<li>Add curves to the legs as well, giving the emu two toes and a bit of a backwards knee.
<a href="/static/2012/04/emu-tut-step-five.png"><img src="/static/2012/04/emu-tut-step-five-300x240.png" alt="" title="emu tut step five" width="300" height="240" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-955" /></a>
</li>
<li>For the second leg, select and copy the first leg.
Scale the copy down using the ''Transform'' window, and move it under the first leg using the layer controls at the top of the window.
<a href="/static/2012/04/emu-tut-step-six.png"><img src="/static/2012/04/emu-tut-step-six-300x178.png" alt="" title="emu tut step six" width="300" height="178" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-956" /></a>
</li>
<li>Details time!
We''re nearly done, so add the wing and some stripes on the neck using the line tool and adding curves.
<a href="/static/2012/04/emu-tut-step-seven.png"><img src="/static/2012/04/emu-tut-step-seven-300x243.png" alt="" title="emu tut step seven" width="300" height="243" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-957" /></a>
</li>
<li>For the next step, hold ''shift'' and select each of the neck stripes.  This will select all of them at the same time.
To get the cool speckled pattern on the neck, we will change the stroke width, style, and dash pattern on the ''stroke style'' panel of the ''fill and stroke'' window.
<a href="/static/2012/04/emu-tut-step-nine.png"><img src="/static/2012/04/emu-tut-step-nine-300x252.png" alt="" title="emu tut step nine" width="300" height="252" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-960" /></a>
</li>
<li>Before adding color, make sure that your lines are connected and shapes are closed.
I had a gap in the neck shape, so I held shift to select both nodes and pressed the connect button on the top left of the window.
<a href="/static/2012/04/emu-tut-step-nine.png"><img src="/static/2012/04/emu-tut-step-nine-300x252.png" alt="" title="emu tut step nine" width="300" height="252" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-960" /></a>
</li>
<li> To add color, open the fill and stroke window.  To match colors on different shapes, copy and paste the RGBA value or use the eyedropper tool.
<a href="/static/2012/04/emu-tut-step-ten.png"><img src="/static/2012/04/emu-tut-step-ten-300x173.png" alt="" title="emu tut step ten" width="300" height="173" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-961" /></a></li>
<li>Final touches: I decided the head looked too separate from the neck, so I redrew the head and neck as one large shape with the line tool.
<a href="/static/2012/04/emu-tut-step-elev.png"><img src="/static/2012/04/emu-tut-step-elev-300x179.png" alt="" title="emu tut step elev" width="300" height="179" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-962" /></a></li>
<li>
Lastly, I adjusted the face by selecting the features and moving them as a group.
<a href="/static/2012/04/emu-tut-step-twelve.png"><img src="/static/2012/04/emu-tut-step-twelve-300x252.png" alt="" title="emu tut step twelve" width="300" height="252" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-963" /></a></li>

    '<h2>Welcome to the Colors in Inkscape Tutorial:</h2>
This tutorial will show the steps to create color changes like the ones seen below-
<a href="/static/2012/05/colors-in-Inkscape-1.png"><img src="/static/2012/05/colors-in-Inkscape-1-300x160.png" alt="" title="colors in Inkscape 1" width="300" height="160" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-975" /></a>
<!--more-->
<ol><li>
<b>To start:</b>
Open the Fill and Stroke panel under the Object menu at the top.
<a href="/static/2012/05/colors-in-Inkscape-2.png"><img src="/static/2012/05/colors-in-Inkscape-2-300x136.png" alt="" title="colors in Inkscape 2" width="300" height="136" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-976" /></a></li>
<li><b>Anatomy of the Fill and Stroke panel:</b>
Fill tab controls the color inside the shape.
Stroke paint tab controls the color on the outer edge of the shape.
The Wheel tab is the easiest way to see how color changes work.  Use this option for general color adjustments.  However, for precision, we will be using the HSL tab.
<a href="/static/2012/05/colors-in-Inkscape-3.png"><img src="/static/2012/05/colors-in-Inkscape-3-300x190.png" alt="" title="colors in Inkscape 3" width="300" height="190" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-977" /></a></li>
<li><b>Creating a Color Scheme:</b>
Notice the value on the H (Hue) box is 33.  To create a color scheme, (like the browns on our emu), vary the S and L values while keeping the H value set to the same number.
<a href="/static/2012/05/colors-in-Inkscape-4.png"><img src="/static/2012/05/colors-in-Inkscape-4-300x174.png" alt="" title="colors in Inkscape 4" width="300" height="174" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-978" /></a>
Notice the way the two browns match?
That is because they both have an H value of 33!
<a href="/static/2012/05/colors-in-Inkscape-5.png"><img src="/static/2012/05/colors-in-Inkscape-5-300x183.png" alt="" title="colors in Inkscape 5" width="300" height="183" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-979" /></a>
</li>
<li> <b>Changing a Color Scheme:</b>
Here we have changed nothing but the H value for both the stroke and fill, making the Hue a red/pink.
<a href="/static/2012/05/colors-in-Inkscape-6.png"><img src="/static/2012/05/colors-in-Inkscape-6-300x182.png" alt="" title="colors in Inkscape 6" width="300" height="182" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-980" /></a>
That is how you can change a brown emu into a raspberry colored one!  (Just change the H value!)
<a href="/static/2012/05/colors-in-Inkscape-7.png"><img src="/static/2012/05/colors-in-Inkscape-7-300x177.png" alt="" title="colors in Inkscape 7" width="300" height="177" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-981" /></a>
</li>
<li><b>Further Adjustments:</b>
Let''s say you want a bright bubble-gum pink instead of the raspberry color we ended up with.
To get a more vivid color, boost the S (Saturation) value.  
To get a lighter color, change the L (Lightness) value.
<a href="/static/2012/05/colors-in-Inkscape-8.png"><img src="/static/2012/05/colors-in-Inkscape-8-300x181.png" alt="" title="colors in Inkscape 8" width="300" height="181" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-982" /></a>
Changing our emu from raspberry to pink was achieved by boosting the Saturation (S) and Lightness (L).
<a href="/static/2012/05/colors-in-Inkscape-9.png"><img src="/static/2012/05/colors-in-Inkscape-9-300x191.png" alt="" title="colors in Inkscape 9" width="300" height="191" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-983" /></a>
</li>
<li><b>Color Matching:</b>
The most precise way to match colors is to copy and paste the RGBA value.
<a href="/static/2012/05/colors-in-Inkscape-10.png"><img src="/static/2012/05/colors-in-Inkscape-10-300x183.png" alt="" title="colors in Inkscape 10" width="300" height="183" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-984" /></a>
</li>
<li>Playing with Opacity:
The final value, A (Opacity), controls the transparency of shapes.
I use this option least often.
<a href="/static/2012/05/colors-in-Inkscape-11.png"><img src="/static/2012/05/colors-in-Inkscape-11-300x181.png" alt="" title="colors in Inkscape 11" width="300" height="181" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-985" /></a>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>In Summary:</h2>
<ul><li>To create a color scheme, use different colors with the same H value.</li>
<li>To change color schemes, pick a new H value for all your colors, but leave the S and L alone.</li>
<li>To brighten or lighten, increase the S or L values.</li>
<li>And to make see-through shapes, decrease the A value.</li>
</ul>
<a href="/static/2012/05/colors-in-Inkscape-12.png"><img src="/static/2012/05/colors-in-Inkscape-12-300x183.png" alt="" title="colors in Inkscape 12" width="300" height="183" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-986" /></a>

    'To wrap up the series of tutorials on making a cute or kawaii emu in <a href="http://inkscape.org/" title="Inkscape Homepage">Inkscape</a>, (the free vector graphics editor), I''m sharing two variations based on the ''cute emu'' image.  The first image is a fancy peacock, and the second is a fluffy pink emu-corn.

<h2>A peacock is just a fancy little emu.</h2>

The peacock head is exactly the same as the emu head, and the body and neck are one small shape rather than two.  The tail and frame were created by using the ''pattern along path'' tool, which is covered in <a href="http://acedar.blogspot.com/2007/06/inkscape-tutorial-for-text-pattern.html" title="Inkscape Tutorial for pattern text along path">a tutorial by Cedar Wood</a>.  If anyone is interested in that technique send or post any questions you have; it can be a little confusing at first, but it''s a great way to create patterns in Inkscape.

<h2>A Fluffy Pink Emucorn</h2>

In the first two sections we learned <a href="http://flarnie.com/2012/tutorial/cute-inkscape-tutorial-series-kawaii-emu-part-1/" title="Cute Inkscape Tutorial Series: Kawaii Emu part 1">how to make the emu''s head</a> and <a href="http://flarnie.com/2012/tutorial/cute-inkscape-tutorial-series-kawaii-emu-part-2/" title="Cute Inkscape Tutorial Series: Kawaii Emu Part 2">how to make the emu body</a>.
Then we <a href="http://flarnie.com/2012/tutorial/color-in-inkscape/" title="Color in Inkscape">changed the emu from brown to a pale pink</a>.

From there I only took three steps to make the fluffy pink emucorn:
<ol>
<li>Tweak the pose to make the emu look attentively at the viewer. (Straighten the legs and neck, and bring the head/neck up above the body.  I also made the wing larger and moved it to the side.</li>
<li>Replace the ''hair'' with a single horn on the emu''s head.</li>
<li>Place the emu on a rainbow meadow background.  I may cover background creation in a future tutorial, but you can pretty easily figure out how to make a similar background by using the vector pen and adjusting curves/colors of the shapes.</li>

<h3>Sloth Face in 5 steps:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Start with a <a href="http://flarnie.com/2012/tutorial/cute-inkscape-tutorial-series-basic-cute-or-kawaii-face/" title="Cute Inkscape Tutorial Series: Basic Cute or Kawaii Face">basic cute/kawaii face</a>.</li>
<li>Use round dots for eyes, (hold ctrl with circle tool), and a small smile for the mouth.</li>
<li>Add the pink nose and darker pink nostrils with the circle tool. Blur the pink nose.</li>
<li>Group the features (Ctr+G) and move them down a bit.</li>
<li>Last, add colors and make the head wider at the bottom.</li>
</ol>

For reference on making things symmetrical, which is important when drawing faces, see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAwGQobJaec" title="symmetry in Inkscape, tutorial video">this tutorial video</a>.  That is the method I used to make the wider head-shape in the last step here.

Next week I''ll post a full tutorial for the sloth''s body! 
But in the mean time:

I''ve started reading about <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">A.I.</abbr>, and now I just can''t stop!
Lately I''ve been wondering how closely we can use computers to simulate human thought and social interaction.  I know that there has been a ton of research in this field, (just check out the Wikipedia pages for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing" title="Natural Language Processing on Wikipedia">Natural Language Processing</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning" title="Machine Learning on Wikipedia">Machine Learning</a>), but I am curious about just how hard it would be to write these type of programs.  Specifically; what would it take to simulate the process of learning, and to simulate the process of making friends?  How do we define learning and friendship?  What really differentiates us from computers?  If I create a program that has values, sets it''s own goals, is considered a ''friend'' to a human, and experiences growth and change of it''s values and identity, then would it count as a "person"?  Could we say that it "thinks"?  These questions fascinate me.

<!--more-->

I''m also unsure of what category this type of project really falls under.  Since the program I''m imagining would run completely on a PC, and without moving physical parts or having a physical body, it can''t be called robotics. The terms "Machine Learning" and "Artificial Intelligence" are used interchangably, but how can we tell if a computer''s behavior counts as "intelligent"?  Jack Copeland poses the question like so, and answers it with five components of intelligence:  

<quote>"Quite simple human behaviour can be intelligent yet quite complex behaviour performed by insects is unintelligent. What is the difference? ...
Intelligence ... is the ability to adapt one''s behaviour to fit new circumstances.
Mainstream thinking in psychology regards human intelligence not as a single ability or cognitive process but rather as an array of separate components. Research in AI has focussed chiefly on the following components of intelligence: learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language-understanding."</quote>
-from <a href="http://www.alanturing.net/turing_archive/pages/reference%20articles/what%20is%20ai.html" title="What is Intelligence? by Jack Copeland">"What is Artificial Intelligence?"</a>, by Jack Copeland, Director of the Turing Archive for the History of Computing

I want to create a program that simulates the learning and language-understanding components of intelligence, on a basic level.  This seems like computer science, but the questions I have about consciousness and cognition dabble in the realms of philosophy and psychology, and maybe even ethics.  I think the field that more aptly encompasses this proposition is a field that I ran into during my studies at Hampshire College: we called it <a href="http://www.hampshire.edu/cs/" title="School of Cognitive Science at Hampshire College">"Cognitive Science"</a>.  A mix of computer science, artificial intelligence, all types of psychology, and a dash of philosophy are all fair game in this field.

At the moment, this project is just a bright little idea in head.  Like many creative folks, I tend to have far more ideas than I have time to pursue, and at the moment my plate is over-full of projects.  I love being busy.  If or when I do finish some things up, I think this little Cognitive Science experiment will be my next course.  And in the mean time, I am thinking about what to name a program designed to learn new things and make friends.

    'After spending a lot of time looking at sloths, I''ve realized the three-toed sloth is probably the more iconic type of sloth, despite being slightly less cute than the two-toed type.

    'Sloths are cute, and yet their <a href="http://animals.howstuffworks.com/mammals/sloth-info.htm" title="sloths on Animal Planet">long limbs and claws</a> don''t lend them the cartoonish, stubby style that is often termed "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawaii" title="Kawaii on Wikipedia">kawaii</a>".
So how to make a long-limbed and clawed creature cute?  Just like in my earlier tutorial, (How to make <a href="http://flarnie.com/2011/tutorial/inkscape-tutorial-kawaii-art/" title="Inkscape Tutorial: Cute Digital Art">Cute Digital Art</a>), we will round off any sharp corners and extrusions.  This means that our long-limbed sloth takes on the proportions of a gingerbread man.  
So how to draw a cute sloth?  Before you start, take a deep breath and consider my sloth friend''s advice:
<a href="/static/2012/06/sloth-says-stop-small.png"><img src="/static/2012/06/sloth-says-stop-small.png" alt="Sloth says &quot;STOP.... and enjoy life.&quot;" title="sloth-says-stop-small" width="447" height="342" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1081" /></a>
STOP- and enjoy life.

Then read on for the steps to create the body for a cute and kawaii cartoon sloth.

You can see <a href="http://paradasia.deviantart.com/gallery/28994336#/d53sr8i" title="Cute Sloth Full Tutorial as a long image">this tutorial</a> on my deviantart page, posted as one string of notated screenshots.
<h2>Welcome to the Cute Sloth Tutorial:</h2>
<ol>
<li>You should already have the cute sloth face from the <a href="http://flarnie.com/2012/tutorial/cute-inkscape-tutorial-series-kawaii-sloth-face/" title="Cute Inkscape Tutorial Series: Kawaii Sloth Face">previous tutorial</a>.
</li>
<li>Use the vertical ''guides'' to mark the center and side of the sloth''s face, and horizontal guides to mark the bottom of his mouth and the spot where you want his feet to stand.
<a href="/static/2012/06/sloth-tut-step-1.png"><img src="/static/2012/06/sloth-tut-step-1-300x185.png" alt="" title="sloth tut step 1" width="300" height="185" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1111" /></a>
To create a blue ''guide''line: hover on the side of the screen, click on the grey triangle, and hold while pulling the ''guide'' into view.
</li>
<li>Use the ''freehand lines'' tool to draw half of the body, using the guides to mark the top of the arm and the bottom of the feet.
This outline can be rough, like a sketch.
Try to make the limbs short, and they should meet the body near the guideline that marks the side of the sloth''s face.
</li>
<li> Next, use the ''pen tool'' to follow the rough outline.
When using the pen tool, draw straight lines across the curves.  After drawing the whole outline we''ll adjust those places to make smooth curves.
<a href="/static/2012/06/sloth-tut-step-3-4.png"><img src="/static/2012/06/sloth-tut-step-3-4-300x186.png" alt="" title="sloth tut step 3 4" width="300" height="186" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1112" /></a>
</li>
<li>Use the ''Edit Paths'' tool and pull down on the straight lines, creating curves.
Also, make sure that each paw is defined by 4 points.  If there are more or less, adjust the number of points on the paws.
<a href="/static/2012/06/sloth-tut-step-51.png"><img src="/static/2012/06/sloth-tut-step-51-300x186.png" alt="" title="sloth tut step 5" width="300" height="186" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1113" /></a>
</li>
<li>Now we use those 4 points on each paw:
Pull curves out between the points,creating 3 toes on each paw.
<a href="/static/2012/06/sloth-tut-step-61.png"><img src="/static/2012/06/sloth-tut-step-61-300x191.png" alt="" title="sloth tut step 6" width="300" height="191" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1114" /></a>
</li>
<li> With curves in place, it''s time to delete the first line we drew.
</li>
<li> Smoothing the shape:
You''ll notice that the new line is still lumpy and inconsistent.  Zoom in with the magnifying glass and select the ''Edit Paths'' tool again.
Choose points with slight bumps and then ''Make selected nodes smooth'' with the button on the top bar.
<a href="/static/2012/06/sloth-tut-step-7-8.png"><img src="/static/2012/06/sloth-tut-step-7-8-300x186.png" alt="" title="sloth tut step 7 8" width="300" height="186" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1115" /></a>
</li>
<li> Select the body shape and choose Edit>Copy, then Edit>Paste In Place.
This creates a copy in the exact same position as the original.
<a href="/static/2012/06/sloth-tut-step-91.png"><img src="/static/2012/06/sloth-tut-step-91-300x192.png" alt="" title="sloth tut step 9" width="300" height="192" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1116" /></a>
</li>
<li> IMPORTANT: Double-click the shape so that the arrows show rotation, and find the center piont. (A plus sign.)
Move the center point over to the right dotted boundary of the shape by clicking and dragging.
</li>
<li>With the copied shape selected, choose ''Flip selected objects horizontally'' on the top bar.
This is the easy way to create a symmetrical shape.
<a href="/static/2012/06/sloth-tut-step-10-11.png"><img src="/static/2012/06/sloth-tut-step-10-11-300x187.png" alt="" title="sloth tut step 10 11" width="300" height="187" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1117" /></a>
</li>
<li>Connect the two sides: 
Select both end-points by holding shift, and then hit ''Join selected endnodes with a new segment'' on the top.
<a href="/static/2012/06/sloth-tut-step-121.png"><img src="/static/2012/06/sloth-tut-step-121-300x187.png" alt="" title="sloth tut step 12" width="300" height="187" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1118" /></a>
</li>
<li>Use the eyedropper tool to match the body fill and the stroke to the eye-patches of the face, and then click on the top to ''Lower selection to the bottom''.
<a href="/static/2012/06/sloth-tut-step-131.png"><img src="/static/2012/06/sloth-tut-step-131-300x186.png" alt="" title="sloth tut step 13" width="300" height="186" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1119" /></a>
The last few steps involve adding claws.
</li>
<li>Adding the claws:
Starting with just one paw, use the ''pen tool'' to draw a skinny triangle pointing out from each toe.

Then create a new shape on top of each triangle, with two points on either side of each corner of the triangle.
<a href="/static/2012/06/sloth-tut-step-141.png"><img src="/static/2012/06/sloth-tut-step-141-300x198.png" alt="" title="sloth tut step 14" width="300" height="198" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1120" /></a>
</li>
<li>Rounding them off:
Use the path edit tool to pull curves out at the ''corners'' of your new shapes.
</li>
<li>When this is done, delete the original triangles and adjust colors on the remaining rounded triangles.
Colors can be adjusted by opening the ''Fill and Stroke'' panel, under Object>Fill and Stroke on the top menu bar, or by holding (Shift+Ctrl+F).
<a href="/static/2012/06/sloth-tut-step-15-16.png"><img src="/static/2012/06/sloth-tut-step-15-16-300x187.png" alt="" title="sloth tut step 15 16" width="300" height="187" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1121" /></a>
</li>
<li>Lastly, duplicate the claws and flip them horizontally, (by using the button at the top), so that they can be placed on the opposite paw.

Make claws for the bottom paws by repeating steps 14-17.
<a href="/static/2012/06/sloth-tut-step-171.png"><img src="/static/2012/06/sloth-tut-step-171-300x190.png" alt="" title="sloth tut step 17" width="300" height="190" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1122" /></a>
And you have a completed sloth!
</li>
</ol>
This general approach could be used to draw any creature with similar proportions.

    'I need to interrupt my regularly scheduled blogging because a year ago today I was just learning how to use WordPress, and today I am putting the finishing (hopefully) touches on a fairly complicated plugin written in two languages (javascript and PHP) that only 9 months or so ago I would have found too difficult.  It is time to give credit, because I never could have learned and done so much on my own.  I want to acknowledge the role of prayer in my work process, and the continuing support of my spouse and life partner Josh.

<h2>How to Get Things Done</h2>
To do anything, all that is needed is the motivation to try and a means to achieve it.  I thank God for providing me with both of those.
<a href="/static/2012/07/how-i-work.png"><img src="/static/2012/07/how-i-work-1024x368.png" alt="" title="how-i-work" width="640" height="230" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1141" /></a>

<!--more-->
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<q>"Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for men."</q>
<a href="http://bible.cc/colossians/3-23.htm" title="Colossians 3-23 on Bible.cc">Colossians 3:23</a>

What do you tell yourself when you feel like giving up?  When I think of my past, it always helped me to have a parent, teacher, or mentor in my life who I knew believed in me and who would share my joy in succeeding.  On my own I would be tempted to take the easy way out and quit, but with someone else rooting for me I find strength within myself to keep going, even when things are difficult.  I know it may seem strange, but my connection with God works the same way, but amplified: God is the ''parent, teacher, or mentor'' of the world and of my whole life.
Everyone has times that they feel self-doubt, or wonder if what they are attempting is worthwhile.  I am happiest when I remember that it''s not the endeavor itself that is important, but rather that I put forth superhuman effort and know within myself that I did the best that I could.  That''s what I get from Colossians 3:23.

<h2>Means</h2>
Nothing that I have done or gained in life was through my own merit.  I think that anyone honestly assessing their life will be able to say that same thing.  My safe and happy upbringing was a gift; the teachers who encouraged me were a gift; and my own "success" in school was a gift.  Those gifts gave me the ability to complete a year of Americorps, get a BA, and earn a teaching license.  These too were gifts, possible because of abilities I was born with and the support of my family.  Being at college gave me the chance to meet and fall in love with a person so perfect for me that their very existence inspires in me a deeper faith in the meaning behind life, and that was a gift.  My own initial luck at finding work, combined with the support of our families, allowed my love a chance to study computer science and begin his own career, and that was a gift.  Now his career allows him to support and mentor me in learning web design, and as I start my own second career it is a gift.  In every case, the choices I am able to make are possible because of gifts that came before, and for each of those gifts I thank God.
Now, I know if I go too far with this logic, I seem to run into contradictions.  If God created all the good things in life, even the good choices, then didn''t God create the bad things too?  Why would God make things hard?  Why would God create a fallen world?  In moments of loss or frustration, I have asked these questions.
Even in bad times, I come to the conclusion that life must be taken as a whole: If you took your favorite book and cut out all the difficult or sad or dangerous parts, what would be left?  Would the story still be meaningful?  Would it be moving?  Would it teach anything?  Without shadow, light cannot be seen.  God is the author of life, and while I''m not always happy with the story, I am still thankful to be in the story.  And if my life story includes the means to overcome a challenge, then I thank God, (the author), for including that means.

<h2>Thanks</h2>
I have only been doing web development and design for a year, and I am rapidly approaching the point where I can make a website do almost anything.  I have never taken a course in web design: Today, <b>you can learn anything on the internet.</b>  (Except maybe <a href="http://www.fi.edu/learn/heart/healthy/openheart.html" title="Learn Open Heart Surgery online">open heart surgery?</a>)  If you don''t believe me, check out my <a href="http://flarnie.com/web-design-resources/" title="Web Design Resources">web design resources section</a> or start surfing <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/" title="wikipedia">wikipedia</a>.
So today I think God for the internet, for Josh (my love), and for life.     ',

Using Raphael js makes it easy to draw <strong>simple</strong> shapes and add interactivity using javascript, but I''m not sure I would recommend it for complex vector images.  It makes things possible that not even Flash can achieve, but be warned that to actually use a complex vector image file, (like something you would draw in Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator), requires many steps to convert the SVG information into the Raphael format.

<h2>Raphael JS Features and Challenges</h2>
<table border="0">
<tr>
<th><b>Cool Features</b></th>
<th><b>Issues</b></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Best Part: <i>Fluid Images</i> (a.k.a. flexible images or responsive images) <i>with flash-like animations in modern browsers</i>, with static VML fallback support in older browsers.  This is the true advantage of using Raphael JS.
</td>
<td>
Worst Part: <i>Raphael does not convert SVG image files into javascript.</i>  You must either hand-convert the SVG file into the Raphael format, write a script to parse it for you, or hand-code your SVG/vector shapes in the Raphael format.  There are several online ''converters'' for SVG to Raphael JS, but they didn''t ''just work'' for me so I wrote my own script.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<i>Cross browser SVGs</i>: Raphael really does render your images in legacy IE as well as modern browsers, by switching to VML when SVG is not supported.
</td>
<td>
<i>Cross browser issues</i>: Be warned that browsers will each act slightly differently when running Raphael JS, because SVG and VML support in browsers is still varied and quirky.  Raphael fills in enough of the cracks to make SVG practical, but the differences are still there.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<i>Complete documentation</i>: the Raphael JS home page has <a href="http://raphaeljs.com/reference.html" title="Raphael JS Documentation">documentation</a> for every function and lots of demos.  I recommend using <a href="http://getfirebug.com/" title="Firebug web development tool">Firebug</a> or other development tools to check out the code for the demo pages.
</td>
<td>
<i>Lack of examples and tutorials</i>: While the documentation is great, I often found myself wanting examples.  There are a few great tutorials out there, (which I will share), but I look forward to a time when there are more.

That must be intentional, right?  I wonder if perhaps their intention was that the letters be even more obvious.  A third possibility is that the icon is only meant to show a stylized letter ''R'', and that the other letters are a coincidence.  I think it looks cool, but if I''m spending so much time speculating about it''s meaning, perhaps it is too vague?

It reminds me of a drawing game I used to play as a kid, where you make a design that incorporates all the letters of your name.  It''s a fun art exercise, but it doesn''t automatically produce a good design.

<ol>
<li>Start with a basic cute/kawaii face.</li>
<li>Make larger eyes, and a new head shape, like an oval with a flat chin. (I did this by making an oval and then flattening the bottom a bit.)</li>
<li>Draw an ear and half of the mouth, then copy and flip them horizontally.</li>
<li>Draw one tooth and copy it in the same way.</li>
<li>Last, fill in the ears and face with pink!</li>

<h2>Welcome to the Cute Naked Mole Rat Tutorial:</h2>
<ol>
<li>You should already have the head from the previo9us tutorial.  Make an oval about the same size as the head.
</li>
<li>Adjust the shape of the oval so it droops a big, using the ''Path>Object to Path'' on the top menu and the ''edit paths'' tool on the left.
<a href="/static/2012/07/mole-tut-step-1-2.png"><img src="/static/2012/07/mole-tut-step-1-2-300x185.png" alt="" title="mole-tut-step-1-2" width="300" height="185" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1219" /></a>
</li>
<li>Position the torso shape beneath the head and lower it to the bottom using the button at the top.
<a href="/static/2012/07/mole-tut-step-3.png"><img src="/static/2012/07/mole-tut-step-3-300x190.png" alt="" title="mole-tut-step-3" width="300" height="190" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1220" /></a>
</li>
<li>Use the bezier curves tool (Shift + F6) and the edit paths tool to draw an arm and leg.
The leg should point away from the body to one side, forming an almost 90 degree angle.
<a href="/static/2012/07/mole-tut-step-4.png"><img src="/static/2012/07/mole-tut-step-4-300x190.png" alt="" title="mole-tut-step-4" width="300" height="190" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1221" /></a>
</li>
<li>The Symmetry Trick:
First, select goth the arm and leg and copy them.
Then, under the ''Edit'' menu choose ''Paste in Place''.
Clicking the items twice gives you the ''rotate'' arrows, and a + sign for the center.
Move the center to the center of your animal, then hit the ''Flip selected objects horizontally'' button at the top.

Whew!  You have a symmetrical set of arms and legs!

</li>
<li>Select both legs and the torso, (by clicking and holding shift), and then choose ''Path''>''Union'' on the top menu.
<a href="/static/2012/07/mole-tut-step-6.png"><img src="/static/2012/07/mole-tut-step-6-300x190.png" alt="" title="mole-tut-step-6" width="300" height="190" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1223" /></a>
</li>
<li>Like magic, you have combined the torso and legs into one shape!
Now, to give an illustion of depth, draw a line between the legs that is just a little too long on each side.
<a href="/static/2012/07/mole-tut-step-7.png"><img src="/static/2012/07/mole-tut-step-7-300x190.png" alt="" title="mole-tut-step-7" width="300" height="190" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1224" /></a>
</li>
<li>Making the tail:
Using the bezier curves tool, draw a line with at least 5 points and a bit of zig-zagging.  You can add curves as you go, or add them afterwards like I do in the next step.
<a href="/static/2012/07/mole-tut-step-8.png"><img src="/static/2012/07/mole-tut-step-8-300x190.png" alt="" title="mole-tut-step-8" width="300" height="190" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1225" /></a>
</li>
<li>If you haven''t already added curves, use the ''edit paths'' tool again to add curves to the tail.
Try to make the handles on each node point directly out, so the curves are completely rounded.
<a href="/static/2012/07/mole-tut-step-9.png"><img src="/static/2012/07/mole-tut-step-9-300x190.png" alt="" title="mole-tut-step-9" width="300" height="190" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1226" /></a>
</li>
<li>Select the torso, arms, and bottom line.
Open ''Object>Fill and Stroke'' on the top menu, and set the stroke style to a width of two with rounded join and cap.
<a href="/static/2012/07/mole-tut-step-10.png"><img src="/static/2012/07/mole-tut-step-10-300x189.png" alt="" title="mole-tut-step-10" width="300" height="189" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1227" /></a>
</li>
<li>Select the tail only, and use the ''Fill and Stroke'' panel again to adjust the stroke style to a width of 4.
The tail should also have a rounded join and cap.
<a href="/static/2012/07/mole-tut-step-11.png"><img src="/static/2012/07/mole-tut-step-11-300x189.png" alt="" title="mole-tut-step-11" width="300" height="189" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1228" /></a>
</li>
<li>Last step; make a cute pose by double-clicking and rotating the head and one arm.

    'To use the ''glow'' effect with Raphael JS it is useful to see examples and learn a few tricks.  In this article I outline the following:
<ul>
<li>Creating a glow around a Raphael object</li>
<li>Setting a trigger event for the glow (such as hover)</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="color: #fff; text-shadow: -1px 1px 8px #ffc, 1px -1px 8px #fff; background-color: #A6EDB0; display:inline;">Let''s glow!</h2>
<!--more-->

<h2>Creating a ''Glow'' with Raphael JS</h2>
To use the <a href="http://raphaeljs.com/reference.html#Element.glow" title="Element.glow in the Raphael JS Reference">Element.glow() method</a>, you must first create the Raphael object that you want to glow.  For this example I will create a dot:
<pre lang="javascript">var dot = paper.circle( 15, 25, 10).attr
({fill: "#FFFFFF",  stroke: "#cecece", ''stroke-width'': 1, cursor: "pointer", 
href: http://#link# });</pre>

To clarify: this code will create a circle on the canvas (named ''paper'') placed at the coordinates 15,25 with a diameter of 10.  The style will be as specified in the arguments of .attr(), (meaning the stuff between the {} brackets), and it will be linked to whatever address is entered where "http://#link#" is in the example.

To create a static, permanent ''glow'' effect around this circle, one would write the following:
<pre lang="javascript">
var g = dot.glow({opacity: 1.0, color: "#FFF", width: 10});</pre>
The arguments, (meaning the stuff between the {} brackets), are pretty self explanatory.  You can change the color, width, and opacity of the glow. 
Note: Storing the value in a variable (g in this case) is not necessary, but makes it easier to manipulate the ''glow'' after it is created.  The ''glow'' is actually a set of new objects created within the Raphael JS system that are separate from their parent element, which is ''dot'' in this case.  In fact, depending the structure of your code, ''dot'' may not be the true parent element.  All of these things will effect how the glow reacts when animations are used on the element(s) it is attached to.
  
You will notice that the format of Raphael JS relies heavily on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_chaining#jQuery" title="Method Chaining in jQuery, explained on Wikipedia">chaining</a>, a way of writing code that is used in jQuery.

<h2>Setting a trigger event for the glow</h2>
In this example, we will tell ''dot'' to glow when the mouse hovers on it using the <a href="http://raphaeljs.com/reference.html#Element.hover" title="Element.hover() in the Raphael JS reference">Element.hover() method</a> from Raphael.
To use Element.hover, we first create a function for the mouseover event and one for the mouseout event:
(updated on 8/15 to correct a typo)
<pre lang="javascript">var mouseover = function (event) {  
        this.g = this.glow({
             color: "#FFF",
             width: 100
         });       
}

var mouseout = function (event) {
	this.g.remove();

}</pre>
Alternately one could probably use this.g.hide(); in the mouseout function.
With that done, it is easy to use those functions as arguments for the Element.hover method:
<pre lang="javascript">
	dot.hover(mouseover, mouseout);</pre>

You can also see this approach <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8275738/how-to-add-and-remove-glow-for-raphael-element" title="How to add and remove a glow for Raphael element, via Stack Exchange">explained in response to a stack exchange question</a>.

<b>Cool trick:</b> the Element.hover method works in (later versions?) of IE, even though they don''t support the ''hover'' jQuery event on SVG vector elements.  Pretty cool!  So in those cases (from my experience), using Raphael JS is the only way to get cool hover effects on parts of an SVG image.

<h2>This is great!  What could possibly go wrong?</h2>

The biggest issue I had with using ''Element.glow'' in Raphael was removing the glow once it is created.  I will be writing more about that challenge in next week''s post!

    'Wondering how to remove the ''glow'' effect from an element when using the Raphael JS library?
I presented the most common solution in <a href="http://flarnie.com/2012/javascript/raphael-js-glow/" title="Raphael JS: Glow">my previous post</a>, but in cases where the glowing element is wrapped in a link, the .remove() function deletes the original object as well!
Example below: 
(The white dot is a link, the pink dot is not linked to anything.)
<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/paradasia/r48Jj/embedded/result,js,resources,html,css/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>
In this example, the pink dot has the desired ''glow'' behavior triggered by hover, but the white dot simply disappears when the mouse leaves it.  The method I found of fixing this is to store glows in a set and then hide/show them on hover.  Working example below:
<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/bdm7C/27/embedded/result,js,resources,html,css/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>
<strong>Edit: To remove ''Glow'' from a Set, <a href="http://flarnie.com/2013/javascript/unglow-sets-in-raphael-js/" title="Unglow Sets in Raphael JS">see my later post: Unglow Sets in Raphael JS.</a></strong>

A post by <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/1068530/gregdizzia" title="gregdizzia on stack exchange">gregdizzia</a> on stackexchange, (the second answer <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8275738/how-to-add-and-remove-glow-for-raphael-element" title="remove glow for raphael element on stack exchange">here</a>), was my initial solution to this issue.  However, this approach involves tweaking the functions in the actual Raphael JS library, and is admittedly "a bit of a hack".  I found that, using the .set() and show/hide functionality built into Raphael JS, it was possible to avoid fooling with the Raphael library itself.

<h2>Copy and Paste It</h2>
Full code for my example is linked in the jsfiddle window, but I''ll also include it here in case folks have trouble with the iframe:
<pre lang="javascript">
$(document).ready(function() {
    //create the canvas, called ''paper 
    var paper = new Raphael(document.getElementById(''svg-map-box''), "100%", "100%");
    //and a set to hold the glow elements
    var st = paper.set();
    //let''s make a new dot
    var greendot = paper.circle( 75, 75, 20).attr ({fill: "#7FFF00",  stroke: "#cecece", ''stroke-width'': 1, cursor: "pointer", href: "http://#link#" });
    
    var greenover = function (event) { 
            st.push(     
                this.glow({opacity: 1.0, color: "#FFF", width: 25})
                );
    }                
    var greenout = function (event) {                           
        st.hide();
     };   
                  
greendot.hover(greenover, greenout);
    
});                                
</pre>
This code assumes you have already created a div element in your HTML with the id of "svg-map-box", and set the width and background color for that.

    'Using javascript, a long list of links can be made more manageable with the addition of a search bar and sorting functionality.  I''ve synthesized a few existing scripts to create Smart List; a little script that adds a search bar to an HTML list of links making it searchable and sorting the search results based first on relevance and then alphabetically.  Smart List currently uses jQuery, but I think it could easily be tweaked to run independently if needed.

Demo embedded below:
<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/paradasia/VEeTn/1/embedded/result,js,resources,html,css/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<!--more-->

The script brings any exact matches to the top of the list, sorting them by relevance.  Following that are any list items sharing the first letter with the search term, sorted alphabetically.  Any other non-matching list items are left at the end, and alphabetized.  

I may eventually add more to this script, but any changes will depend largely on where I need to use it.  It could be adapted to run without jQuery, or to deal with nested lists.  This version requires that list content be wrapped in ''span'' elements, and that could be changed for a list of mixed element types.

As mentioned in the javascript comments, the script is very much based on the lovely UI (User Interface) used on the <a href="http://raphaeljs.com/reference.html" title="Reference and Documentation for Raphael JS">documentation page for Raphael JS</a>.  My rewrite made the script independant from Raphael JS, completely changed the search functionality, and eliminated features specific to the Raphael JS site.  I think that is it a type of UI that could be easily adapted to many situations.

You can <a href="https://github.com/paradasia/Smart-List-JS" title="Smart List JS on Github">download or fork the code</a> on github.

How to submit: Browse and try sites on their list.
</ul>

<h2>Earn Money Writing Tutorials:</h2>
A subset of the tutorial archive sites I came across will pay folks to submit unique, high quality tutorials. Here are some places to get paid writing tutorials-
<ul>
<li>Site: <b><a href="https://tutsplus.com/" title="Tuts+ Network">Tuts+ Network</a></b>
This is a huge network of sites that focus on tutorials in different areas.  I have used their tutorials before- they tend to be high quality.  They will actually pay for really good tutorials, and each of their sites has different guidelines about what and how to submit.  Definitely worth checking out, no matter what type of tutorial you make.  They have a site for each of the following areas: (as seen in the graphic on the right)<a href="/static/2012/09/tuts-plus-screenshot.png"><img src="/static/2012/09/tuts-plus-screenshot.png" alt="screenshot of the many sites in Tuts+ network" title="tuts plus screenshot" width="428" height="204" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1356" /></a>

CSS Creme accepts tutorials about any topic relating to web design and development, including CSS, PhotoShop, JavaScript, jQuery, Mootools, Fireworks. You can also get paid to submit articles and news. They have a site directory where you can share your own site and be inspired by other designer websites for free.
How to submit: Make a free account.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Social Sharing of Tutorials</h2>
Some of these are obvious, but you may not have considered them as places to share your articles and tutorials.  As far as I know, all of the sites on this list require the creation of a free user account in order to submit art or tutorials.
<ul>
<li>Site: <b><a href="http://www.deviantart.com/" title="Deviant Art">Deviant Art</a></b>
I love DeviantArt- it is a huge and well established community with artists of all ages, cultures, and skill levels.  Professionals like <a href="http://fyre-flye.deviantart.com/" title="Fyre Flye (Lauren Faust) on Deviant Art">Lauren Faust</a> do sometimes have accounts there, in addition to less glamourous people like <a href="http://paradasia.deviantart.com/" title="Paradasia on Deviant Art">myself</a>.  DeviantArt features an entire category for <a href="http://browse.deviantart.com/resources/tutorials/" title="Tutorials on DeviantArt">tutorials</a>.
</li>
<li>Site: <b><a href="http://www.paperdemon.com/" title="Paper Demon- Art and Writing Community">Paper Demon</a></b>
This site is very much like DeviantArt- a community for sharing and enjoying art and writing.  Newer and smaller than DeviantArt, Paper Demon seems to have an emphasis on fan art and anime.  
</li>
<li>Site: <b><a href="https://twitter.com" title="Twitter">Twitter</a></b>
If you haven''t been living under a rock, you probably already know how Twitter works.  Tweeting your tutorial with an appropriate hashtag and a shortened link is a quick way to gain exposure for your tutorial.
</li>
<li>Site: <b><a href="https://plus.google.com/" title="Google Plus">Google+</a></b>
Sharing on Google+ combines some of the features of Twitter and Facebook.  Like Facebook and Twitter, Google+ allows you to <a href="http://support.google.com/plus/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1053549" title="How to Share on Google+">share with your network</a>.  You can also target specific people or "circles" with your updates.  Google+ also uses hashtags, like Twitter.  Hashtags and the "Explore" feature add more chances that your tutorial or article will circulate beyond your own network.
</li>
<li>Site: <b><a href="https://www.facebook.com/" title="Facebook">Facebook</a></b>
Much like Twitter and Google+, Facebook allows you to quickly and easily share your tutorial with your network.  One could make creative use of facebook''s "Events" and "Pages" features to further promote tutorials, but be careful not to spam your friends!
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pick and choose which tutorials you will share.  Look at the guidelines for the site you want to post on, and choose the tutorial that is most relevant and detailed to share.</li>
<li>Use <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/" title="Google Analytics Official Site">google analytics</a>, <a href="http://piwik.org/blog/2008/06/new-plugin-wordpress-piwik-integration/" title="WordPress Piwik Integration">Piwik</a>, or a similar method to track hits to your site, and compare traffic before and after sharing your tutorials.</li>
<li>Think in terms of helping people rather than simply seeking attention.  The internet is improved by folks who really want to share, not by spammers.</li>

<h2>Longer Review</h2>
<!--more-->
For the beginner, there are 3 important things to know about Inkscape:

<ol>
<li>It creates vector graphics, not raster graphics.</li>
<li>It has a ton of features.  I''m still finding new ones after years of playing around with this program!</li>
<li>It''s not intuitive at first.  It will seem especially strange if you''re used to working with another graphics program.</li>
</ol>

The Inkscape Beginner''s Guide really covers all three of these points, allowing the complete novice to get past the first barriers and jump right into the fun stuff- making great designs.

<h2>Vector vs. Raster</h2>

Inkscape was my introduction to vector graphic design, and I remember being very frustrated with it for about 3 months.  I had so many questions, and it felt like I was continually running into brick walls while trying to make even the most simple designs.  Vector and raster graphics are quite different; a general introduction to these differences would probably have allowed me to learn in a weekend what took months of experimentation and ''googling'' to figure out on my own.

An example: Once, (in the early days), I scanned a drawing and opened the resulting .png file in Inkscape.  Using paths, I traced the drawing and started doing some shading and retouching.  When I saved the work-in-progress, I saved the file as .png, and all the vector paths were rasterized.  When I wanted to resume working later, I had lost the ability to edit the paths or separate them from my original scan!  Hours of work had vanished.  This type of "newbie" blunder can be avoided with the knowledge in this book.

<h2>Inkscape is big</h2>

Inkscape is feature-rich, and most of it''s features can be accessed in multiple ways.  Did you know there are (at least?)  4 different ways to change an object''s color in Inkscape?  The advantage of having so many ways to access so many features is that one can find a process that works best for them.  Do you prefer using keyboard shortcuts, or having a set of dockable dialog windows laid out?  In Hiitola''s "Beginner''s Guide", all the methods are exposed so you can find what works best for you.

Another surprising but cool feature of this book is the inclusion of print design and photo manipulation tutorials.  I mainly see Inkscape as a web design tool, and it was interesting to be exposed to it''s other applications.  

<h2>The Verdict: Best for Complete Beginner</h2>

If you have no experience with vector graphics, Inkscape Beginner''s Guide will likely get you creating vector graphics in a weekend.  As a bonus, you''ll be able impress people at parties with your knowledge of Inkscape''s more esoteric features!  (such as the XML editor, filters, and extensions)

Activating ''debug'' mode in WordPress can invalidate the HTML doctype. D''oh!
How I found this epic, stupid bug that took way too long to detect:
<!--more-->
<ol>
	<li>After adding a few features and bug-fixes to a finished theme, I decided to do another round of browser testing. I turned on ''debug'' mode in WordPress and got some VMs set up with IE 8 and 9. AND THE SITE WAS BROKEN. No surprise there.</li>
	<li>After prodding and googling around, I noticed the likely cause of all the issues with my site: the doctype was missing. This sent IE straight into quirksmode, making everything wonky.</li>
	<li>My doctype was still where I left it, right at the top of the ''header'' template. So why weren''t browsers recognizing it? To double-check this, I ran the url through the <a title="W3C Validator" href="http://validator.w3.org/">W3C validator</a>. Sure enough, "No known Document Type could be detected". What had happened to my doctype?</li>
	<li>After reverting and re-implementing all my new features, without effecting the doctype issue, someone suggested I open the source. DUH.</li>
	<li>Here is <strong>why my doctype was ignored:</strong>
If ''DEBUG'' is set to ''true'' in WordPress, error notices are inserted at the very top of the HTML document. The browser parsed these error notices as an invalid doctype statement.  <strong>Debug mode in WordPress invalidates the declared Doctype.</strong> This changes the way the browser interprets your code, meaning it''s very hard indeed to ''debug'' the code and find issues! I can''t believe I didn''t notice it sooner.</li>
</ol>
Lesson: Always view the source code in the browser (not just in firebug, in the template files, or in the WordPress editor.)

<h2>Creative Commons is Big</h2>
When I say "Creative Commons is Big", I mean two things:
Firstly, that usage is increasing around the world.

[caption id="attachment_1430" align="alignnone" width="500" caption="from creativecommons.org &#39;power of open&#39;"]<a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/28041"><img class="size-full wp-image-1430" title="powerofopen-adoption-chart1" src="/static/2012/10/powerofopen-adoption-chart1.png" alt="Use of Creative Commons on the rise" width="500" height="400" /></a>[/caption]

Secondly, this widespread movement is also big in the sense that the subject is vast. There is so much good stuff to say about Creative Commons that it doesn''t all fit in one blog post! Let''s start with three powerful stories:

<h2>Jonathan Coulton Got Noticed</h2>
<small>Headshot credits at end of article</small>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Jonathan_Coulton_13_November_2009.jpg"><img src="/static/2012/10/j-coulton-headshot.jpg" alt="" title="j-coulton-headshot" width="100" height="117" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1512" /></a>
Jonathan Coulton is the artist behind such beloved tunes as "<a title="Live recording/video of J. Coulton playing ''Code Monkey''" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7s8S7QxpjeY">Code Monkey</a>", "<a title="WoW Machinema of J Coulton''s " href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjMiDZIY1bM">re: Your Brains</a>", and "<a title="fan video of " href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4PNpFjKVfY">Tom Cruise Crazy</a>". He became a successful singer-songwriter (and one of my favorite musicians) after he began sharing his music under a CC license. So, does Creative Commons work for a professional musician? Coulton has said,
<h3><q>It’s hard to overstate the degree to which CC has contributed to my career as a musician.</q></h3>
His story is best conveyed in his own words:
<blockquote>"I first learned about Creative Commons when I heard Lawrence Lessig speak at a conference in 2004. ... I was not even Internet Famous then. I was still ... trying to figure out how a career software guy in his mid 30s could ever find a way to make a living writing songs. ...
In those days one of the things that was keeping me from doing music full time was my lack of a coherent plan: I make music, something happens, I make money, that was about as far as I could think it through. Creative Commons filled in a lot of the gaps for me. I knew about the internet of course, I was aware of the rise of remix culture, file sharing, and fan-created content. But there was something so compelling about the Creative Commons license, the idea that you could attach it to a piece of art you had made and declare your intentions – please, share my music, put it in a remix, make it into a music video. I was thrilled and emboldened by the idea that I could give my songs legs, so that they could walk around the world and find their way into places I would never dream of sending them. I immediately started licensing my songs with CC, and a year later I quit my job to create music full time."</blockquote>

The founder of <a title="Khan Academy" href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>, an online tool and resource for learning pretty much anything, started out making youtube videos to tutor his cousins in math. The positive response grew and grew, and eventually Salman Khan left his job to share knowledge full time. And the best part?
<h3><q>If I get hit by a bus tomorrow, I could still continue to teach a million people a year.</q></h3>
-Salman Khan, <em>Power of Open</em>
That''s what I call a legacy.
Salman Khan explains the whole story behind Khan Academy in an excellent TED talk.

<h2>Cory Doctorow on Creative Commons</h2>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/doctorow/4117540692/in/set-72157622138315932"><img src="/static/2012/10/c-doctorow-headshot-2-small.jpg" alt="" title="c-doctorow-headshot-2-small" width="100" height="150" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1520" /></a>Cory Doctorow may be my favorite example of a creator who uses Creative Commons, because in addition to being a success he also eloquently promotes Creative Commons.
His success: Published author of many books, including best-selling novel Little Brother, and co-editor of the popular weblog Boing Boing (boingboing.net).  Also a contributor to The Guardian, the New York Times, Publishers Weekly, Wired, and many other newspapers, magazines and websites. (from C. Doctorow''s <a href="http://craphound.com/bio.php" title="C Doctorow Bio Page">bio page</a> 2012)
His wisdom:
<h3><q>I''ve been giving away my books ever since my first novel came out, and boy has it ever made me a bunch of money.</q></h3>
<blockquote>"...
Most people who download the book don''t end up buying it, but they wouldn’t have bought it in any event, so I haven’t lost any sales, I’ve just won an audience. A tiny minority of downloaders treat the free e-book as a substitute for the printed book--those are the lost sales. But a much larger minority treat the e-book as an enticement to buy the printed book. They''re gained sales. As long as gained sales outnumber lost sales, I''m ahead of the game. After all, distributing nearly a million copies of my book has cost me nothing."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This is, of course, the age of unlimited, zero-marginal-cost copying.  If you blow your works into the net like a dandelion clock on the breeze, the net itself will take care of the copying costs.  Your fans will paste-bombe your works into their mailing lists, making 60,000 copies so fast and so cheaply that figuring out how much it cost in aggregate to make all those copies would be order of magnitude more expensive than the copies themselves.
... Here''s the gist: expend less effort trying to ensure that small sums of money are extracted from your fans for individual copies of your work, and focus instead on getting larger payouts, making each germination count for something more than a buck''s royalties."</blockquote>
-p.35-36 of <a href="http://craphound.com/context/download" title="Context by Cory Doctorow">Context</a> by Cory Doctorow (pdf version)
<blockquote>"[People] want to be able to build on earlier creative works in order to create new, original works because this is the basis of all creativity, and every work they with to make fragmentary or inspirational use of was, in turn, compiled from the works that went before it."</blockquote>

    'What is Open Education?   While it had <a href="http://education.stateuniversity.com/pages/2303/Open-Education.html" title="Open Education in the 1960''s and 1970''s">one meaning in the 1960''s and 70''s</a>, the term now has become associated with online and freely available education resources, also known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources" title="Open Educational Resources on Wikipedia">Open Eduation Resources (OERs)</a>.  Some of the better known examples include <a href="https://www.edx.org/" title="MITX / EdX (Online Learning from MIT and other Schools)">MITX/EdX</a>, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/" title="Coursera - online courses">Coursera</a>, and <a href="http://www.udacity.com/" title="Udacity- ''Learn, Think, Do.  Education for Free.''">Udacity</a>; all three provide online college courses for free.  

At the risk of generalizing, one can say that Open Education includes three components:
<ul>
<li><strong>Open Education utilizes technology</strong> to connect learners, resources, and teachers from around the world.
</li>
<li><strong>Open Education eliminates barriers to learning</strong>: including all interested students, making learning free of cost, and allowing free distribution of learning materials with Creative Commons.
</li>
<li><strong>Open Education is a new model of learning.</strong>  This model can supplement traditional classroom learning, and in some cases even replace it.
</li>
</ul>

The following quote really sums it up:
<a href="/static/2012/11/power-of-open-quote-1.jpg"><img src="/static/2012/11/power-of-open-quote-1-300x300.jpg" alt="" title="power-of-open-quote-1" width="300" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1600" /></a>

That quote is from a book about Creative Commons, and I see a complete overlap between the goals of Creative Commons and the Open Education movement.
<q>Our vision is nothing less than realizing the full potential of the Internet - universal access to culture, education and research - to drive a new era of development, growth and productivity.</q><cite>(p.6 of <a href="http://thepowerofopen.org/" title="The Power of Open- Creative Commons E-Book">Power of Open</a>)</cite>

<h2>Where is this going?</h2>
Many questions are raised by the Open Education movement.  Does this new ocean of resources compete with the traditional education system?  Does it enhance the traditional system?  Can they coexist, and is Open Education sustainable?  Should we compare Open Education resources to existing educational resources, and if so how do they compare?  Does Open Education apply to primary or early education?  What is the benefit of systematic public education anyway?  
I look forward to seeing the answers to these questions as things progress.

<h2>Codecademy Has Potential</h2>
If learning is your goal, the game-like interface and buffet of topics on Codecademy makes for fun and fast learning.  The biggest drawback of this site are regular issues with bugs and glitches, and these are to be expected as new content is added and the site grows.  I have encountered 4-5 bugs in a few weeks of use, so I''m on the fence about whether I will continue with the site.

<h2>Pros and Cons</h2>
<strong>Codecademy is Great</strong>
<ul>
<li>Game-like features are addicting</li>
<li>Humorous or silly projects</li>
<li>Variety of exercises and topics</li>
<li>Progression is graduatl, starts with basics</li>
<li>Interactive learning > Lectures</li>
</ul>

<strong>Codecademy Drives Me Crazy</strong>
<ul>
<li>Console/interpreter is buggy</li>
<li>Too many puns and Monty Python jokes (maybe...)</li>
<li>Quality and style of courses varies by author</li>
<li>Progression of difficulty is bumpy at times</li>
<li>UI needs some work</li>
</ul>
I do think that overall Codecademy is a great resource, and I''ve added it to <a href="http://flarnie.com/web-design-resources/" title="Web Design Resources">my resource page</a>.  Read on for more details on the good and bad of this learning tool.

<h2>Finding the Fun</h2>
<q>In every job that must be done, there is an element of fun. You find the fun, and - SNAP - the job''s a game! 
<cite><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058331/quotes?qt=qt0437033" title="Marry Poppins quote on fun">-Mary Poppins</a></cite></q>
Coding is already fun, and Codecademy takes that fun one step further by making the whole learning process feel very much like a game.  I found myself “playing” through the exercises during my free time while a game I recently purchased sat untouched.  And though I enjoyed the points and badges at first, these aren''t inherently motivating.  I think the more powerful element is the range of choices offered to the player: there are hundreds of exercises covering 4 languages (if you count HTML), and the user sets their own pace.  The inclusion of humor, although sometimes groan-inducing, made me smile.  The Python courses by Eric Weinstein are especially impressive- I have never seen so many Monty Python references in one place.
<a href="/static/2012/10/codecademy-python-jokes-screenshot.png"><img src="/static/2012/10/codecademy-python-jokes-screenshot-1024x563.png" alt="" title="codecademy-python-jokes-screenshot" width="640" height="351" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1561" /></a>

<h2>Please Fix It</h2>
During the completion of about 10 courses, there were 5 instances where I had to stop because of bugs or issues in the web interface.  In 4/5 cases, I knew that my code was correct but the console/interpeter did not ''pass'' me on the exercise.  The first three times this happened, I waited and returned to the exercise.  Upon my return, the console/interpreter accepted as correct the same answer which was rejected initially.  Most recently, waiting did not produce a different result, and I emailed the ''help'' department.  They responded quickly, and are looking into the issue.
It is worth note that I was using recent versions of both Chrome and Firefox web browsers, in hopes of avoiding browser-specific issues.

<h2>A Good Supplement</h2>
Because of the variation in authors, the courses in each “track” are not necessarily a finely-tuned progression.  For this reason, it makes sense to combine Codecademy with independent study of coding and the language in question.  If you have no exposure to code before jumping into Codecademy, be prepared to do some googling as you go along.  
I noticed this most when I was doing the javascript track.  For instance, there was no mention or reminder in early exercises that arrays and other things start counting from 0 rather than 1.  It was also a surprise that primitives were not covered in detail until section 4.  Of course, these are really minor issues.  I still enjoyed the exercises, and it''s likely that most folks who would try Codecademy have some exposure to programming already.

<h2>Overall:</h2>
<a href="/static/2012/10/codecademy-screenshot-small.png"><img src="/static/2012/10/codecademy-screenshot-small.png" alt="" title="codecademy-screenshot-small" width="500" height="296" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1559" /></a>
Codecademy succeeds in gamifying the process of learning to code, and as their interface becomes more stable it will be a truly useful and fun site.  <a href="http://www.codecademy.com" title="Codecademy.com">Check it out.</a>

</li>
<li>Draw a symmetrical ''neck'' shape for the screen, and round the edges using the node tool.
To create symmetry, draw one half of the shape, copying and flipping it to get the other half.
<a href="/static/2012/10/step-9-cute-pc-pt1.png"><img src="/static/2012/10/step-9-cute-pc-pt1-300x190.png" alt="" title="step-9-cute-pc-pt1" width="300" height="190" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1540" /></a>
</li>
<li>Draw a rounded rectangle.  Convert it to a path.  Using the node adjustment tool, raise the top left node and round out the left side.
Round the other corners of this shape as well.

<li>Use the rectangle tool to make a tall rectangle, just a bit shorter than the height of the keyboard and screen.
Make sure to use rounded corners.
<a href="/static/2012/10/step-1-cute-pc-pt.2.png"><img src="/static/2012/10/step-1-cute-pc-pt.2-300x188.png" alt="" title="step-1-cute-pc-pt.2" width="300" height="188" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1581" /></a>
</li>
<li>Copy the first rectangle and position them next to the screen and keyboard.  The bottom rectangle shoudl overlap just past the vertical center axis of the first one.  
<a href="/static/2012/10/step-2-cute-pc-pt.2.png"><img src="/static/2012/10/step-2-cute-pc-pt.2-300x189.png" alt="" title="step-2-cute-pc-pt.2" width="300" height="189" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1582" /></a>
</li>
<li>Align guides to connect the outer edges of each rounded corner, as shown in the screenshot.  To create diagonal guides, pull out a normal guide and shift-click-drag it.
</li>
<li>Use the pen tool to draw a shape connecting the top edge of both rectangles.  
Note: This shape should overlap the bottom rectangle.
<a href="/static/2012/10/step-3-4-cute-pc-pt.2.png"><img src="/static/2012/10/step-3-4-cute-pc-pt.2-300x187.png" alt="" title="step-3-4-cute-pc-pt.2" width="300" height="187" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1583" /></a>
</li>
<li>Use the pen tool to draw a side panel, using the guides as in step four.  Color the side panel dark green and lower it beneath the front rectangle and top shape.
<a href="/static/2012/10/step-5-cute-pc-pt.2.png"><img src="/static/2012/10/step-5-cute-pc-pt.2-300x188.png" alt="" title="step-5-cute-pc-pt.2" width="300" height="188" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1584" /></a>
</li>
<li>Draw the disk drive, USB ports, and power button on the front rectangle using the rounded rectangle tool.  This fills the top falk of the containing rectangle, and you can very the configuration of shapes for variety.
Remember to aligh shapes with guides, leaving a bit of space on the top and sides of each one.
<a href="/static/2012/10/step-6-cute-pc-pt.2.png"><img src="/static/2012/10/step-6-cute-pc-pt.2-300x187.png" alt="" title="step-6-cute-pc-pt.2" width="300" height="187" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1585" /></a>
</li>
<li>Draw a rounded rectangle in the bottom half.
</li>
Note: Steps 8-11 are a bit advanced.  For more info on using "pattern along path" and "clipping", see the links at the end.
<li>Make a diagonal line across the rectangle.
<a href="/static/2012/10/step-7-8-cute-pc-pt.2.png"><img src="/static/2012/10/step-7-8-cute-pc-pt.2-300x188.png" alt="" title="step-7-8-cute-pc-pt.2" width="300" height="188" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1586" /></a>
</li>
<li>Make a small dot, and select both the dot and the diagonal line, holding shift.  With these selected, choose ''extensions>generate from path> pattern along path'' from the top menu.
Check the box for "live preview" and tweak the values until the row of dots looks nice and even.
</li>
<li>Copy and align the row of dots, and then copy the copies.
<a href="/static/2012/10/step-9-10-cute-pc-pt.2.png"><img src="/static/2012/10/step-9-10-cute-pc-pt.2-300x188.png" alt="" title="step-9-10-cute-pc-pt.2" width="300" height="188" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1587" /></a>
</li>
<li>Draw a shape containing all the dots you want to show, and fill it with color.  Group all dots, and then select both the dots and the shape. (Hold ''shift'' and click to select multiple shapes.)  
Finally, with these selected, choose ''Object>clip>set'' from the top menu.
(To undo this action, select the resulting shape and choose ''Object>clip>release''.)
<a href="/static/2012/10/step-11-cute-pc-pt.2.png"><img src="/static/2012/10/step-11-cute-pc-pt.2-300x188.png" alt="" title="step-11-cute-pc-pt.2" width="300" height="188" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1588" /></a>

If your WordPress plugin or theme has special functionality that is triggered by the "publishing" or other change to a page or post, then you will be using the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/_transition_post_status" title="Documentation on the Transition_post_status hook">transition_post_status hook</a>.  I had to experiment quite a bit with this hook to determine the keywords actually used for $new_status and $old_status, and now I''m sharing the complete list of my findings.  Read on for a reference guide on what specific post transitions are called when any type of action is taken within the WordPress Admin.  (Tested as of WordPress version 3.1)
<!--more-->
In most cases, two separate transitions were triggered by one action, and in that case the first and second status keywords are separated by a line ( | ).
This pattern seems to hold for both ''pages'' and ''posts'', BUT custom post types don''t get the ''new'' and ''inherit'' status emitted on each change like the others.
<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>Action Taken</th>
<th>Old Status</th>
<th>New Status</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Create new post</td>
<td>new</td>
<td>auto-draft</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Wrote something in the new post</td>
<td>auto-draft</td>
<td>draft</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Waited (autosave ran)</td>
<td>draft</td>
<td>draft</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Saved draft</td>
<td>new | draft</td>
<td>inherit | draft</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Saved and published for first time</td>
<td>new | draft</td>
<td>inherit | publish</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Updated published post</td>
<td>new | publish</td>
<td>inherit | publish</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Scheduled post for future publish</td>
<td>new | draft</td>
<td>inherit | future</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Changed scheduled post to private</td>
<td>new | future</td>
<td>inherit | private</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Set private future-post to new future-publish date</td>
<td>new | private</td>
<td>inherit | private</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sent regular, published post to trash</td>
<td>new | publish</td>
<td>inherit | trash</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Permanently deleted post from trash</td>
<td>(Nothing)</td>
<td>(Nothing)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sent privately scheduled post to trash</td>
<td>new | private</td>
<td>inherit | trash</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Restored privately scheduled post from trash</td>
<td>new | trash</td>
<td>inherit | private</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Restored regularly published post from trash</td>
<td>new | trash</td>
<td>inherit | publish</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Made private scheduled post public</td>
<td>new | private</td>
<td>inherit | publish</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Let the scheduled post reach it''s publication time</td>
<td>future</td>
<td>publish</td>
</tr>
</table>  

It seems like there should be an easier way to hook into specific types of post transitions.  I wanted to trigger certain updates whenever a post was made public, and for that I need to separately hook into all of the following transitions: draft-to-publish, auto-draft-to-publish, private-to-publish, future-to-publish, trash-to-publish, etc.
Anyway, I hope that this is helpful!',

    'This is another example of animation with Raphael JS, the JavaScript library for generating and animating cross-browser vector graphics.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/paradasia/2mCDe/5/embedded/result,js,resources,html,css/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>
Animating a transition between two colors is easy, but what if you want the animation to loop?  And what about multiple colors?  This function takes a list of colors as input and animates the target element.  Optionally, the timing and transition style of the animation can be specified, otherwise they are set to a default of 2 seconds and "linear".  (The Raphael JS homepage has a demo of the available animation, or "easing" styles <a href="http://raphaeljs.com/easing.html" title="Demo of Easing or Animation Styles in Raphael JS">here</a>.)
When working with Raphael JS animations, this function could be used as a template for other types of looped animation.
Read on for an explanation of the code.
<!--more-->

<h2>Looping JavaScript Animation with Raphael JS</h2>

The key is to set the initial value of the attribute, and then to pass the name of the function again as the last argument of Element.animate().
The author of the Raphael JS library provides a concise <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4138644/why-wont-my-raphael-js-animation-loop" title="Why won''t my Raphael JS animation loop?  Post on Stack Overflow">example</a> in response to a post on stackoverflow:
<pre lang="javascript">
var starSpin = function () {
    logoStar.attr({rotation: 0}).animate({rotation: 360}, 5000, starSpin);
}

//Animation from 360° to 360° looks like there no animation, 
//so you need to reset rotation to zero before.
</pre>

<h2>Multiple Animations in a Que</h2>

To create a looping sequence of animations requires a sort of nesting of functions within Element.animate().  In the example, the background element transitions through three values for the "fill" attribute.  Simply writing a function with three uses of Element.animate() will not work- only the last call to Element.animate() will be executed.  

<h3>The Hard Way</h3>
Instead, each animation must finish by calling the next animation, with the final animation restarting the sequence.
<pre lang="javascript">
var colorchange = function(e) {

var third = function(){
    e.attr({fill:"red"}).animate({fill:"blue"}, 5000, 
function(){colorchange(e)}); }


var second = function(){
    e.attr({fill:"yellow"}).animate({fill:"red"}, 5000, third) }

var first = function(){
    e.attr({fill:"blue"}).animate({fill:"yellow"}, 5000, second); }

first()

}
</pre>
In the above example, three functions are defined: ''first'', ''second'', and ''third''.  The ''first'' function specifies a call to the ''second'' after it''s animation, and the ''second'' specifies a call to the ''third'' after it''s animation.  The ''third'' and final function calls the containing function, starting the whole sequence again.  After defining these three functions, we only need call ''first'' to set them all in motion.  

<h3>The Easy Way</h3>
The previous example makes it clear what is happening, but would be cumbersome for more than a few colors.  By putting the attribute values for each animation in an array, the entire chain is condensed into one function:
<pre lang="javascript">
//the ''colors'' argument is an array of colors
var exampleColorList = [''red'', ''blue'', ''yellow''];

//The above array will be given as an argument to the following function
var colorchange = function (colors, target, seconds=2, style=''linear'') { 
//grab the first color from the list
var firstcolor = colors.shift();

//create a new color array with the old ''first'' color at the end
var newcolors = [firstcolor]
newcolors = colors.concat(newcolors);

//add the ''first'' color back to the original 
colors = [firstcolor].concat(colors);

//Transition between the first two colors in the list, 
//and then restart with the new color array 
//(which has the first color removed and stuck on the end.)
    target.attr({fill:colors[0]}).animate({fill:colors[1]}, seconds*1000, style, function(){colorchange(newcolors, target, seconds, style)});
}
</pre>
<h2>Avoiding an Overflow or Infinite Loop</h2>
If your animation seems jumpy, doesn''t work, or you get pop-ups from the browser that read 
<output>"A script on this page may be busy, or it may have stopped responding. 
You can stop the script now, or you can continue to see if the script will complete."</output>
then you have made a small and subtle error that is causing an out of control loop in your script.  A possible cause is calling a function in the Element.animate() instead of simply providing the function to be called.  
<b>WRONG:</b>
<pre>Element.animate(… colorchange(newcolors, target, seconds, style););</pre>

<b>CORRECTED:</b>
<pre>Element.animate(...<mark>function(){</mark>colorchange(newcolors, target, seconds, style)<mark>}</mark> );</pre>

    'The need to parse SVG (scalable vector graphics) files from Inkscape directly into the Raphael JS format is one of the major hurdles to really using the Raphael JS vector graphics library.  For my own projects, I''ve had the help of several python scripts that assist in this task, and thought I would share some of the results.

<h1>SVG to Raphael JS: svgConverter.py</h1>
This is a small script with the potential to be very helpful.  

<h2>Summary</h2>

A script to convert SVG files to Raphael JS. This was designed for SVG files generated by the <a href="http://inkscape.org" title="Inkscape homepage">Inkscape Vector Graphics program</a>. 

<h2>Purpose</h2>

This script is designed to parse SVG files for conversion to the Raphael JS format. <a href="http://raphaeljs.com/" title="Raphael JS 2.0 website">Raphael JS 2.0</a> is a javascript library that generates and animates cross-browser friendly vector graphics for the web. Some SVG images have too many paths for manually copy-pasting into Raphael JS formatting. This script reads the SVG file as XML and generates a Raphael JS canvas of the same size. It then grabs all the ''path'' elements in the SVG and their attributes, writing a javascript array containing this data. It ends by writing a javascript loop to draw each path on the Raphael JS canvas.

<h2>How to Use</h2>

To prepare an SVG file in Inkscape for parsing: 
<ul>
<li>Select all, and then under the ''Path'' top menu choose ''Object to Path'' </li>
<li>Eliminate all layers by copy-pasting all paths onto the blank page and deleting layers </li>
<li>Select all paths and the ''Path'' top menu choose ''Break Apart''</li>
(Caution: using the ''Break Apart'' command on images that are generated from a raster image can alter the fill of ''open'' areas.  This can be manually fixed for simple images.)
</ul>

These steps will simplify the structure of the SVG file and allow the svgConverter to parse it easily.

When run, svgConverter.py will convert all SVG files in the same directory to Raphael JS format, saving the result in a new file without altering the original SVG.

In three steps:

<ol><li>Prepare an SVG file with Inkscape and put it in the same directory as svgConverter.py</li>

<li>Open a terminal in that directory.</li>

<li>With python installed, run svgConverter.py (type ''python svgConverter.py'')</li>
</ol>
It will create a js file using the original SVG filename followed by ''.converted.js''.

<h2>Looking to the Future</h2>
<h3>jQuery UI Grid Delayed</h3>
The jQuery Project made a <a href="http://jquery.org/updates/2012/01/19/grid-status-update-19/" title="jQuery Grid Status Update Jan 19">recent announcement</a> that their much anticipated Grid component will be delayed in order to devote more resources to jQuery 1.9.  For the moment there are an abundance of other grid libraries to choose from, but if and when there is a jQuery UI grid component it will provide another open source grid option that promises to combine the best of existing grid libraries in a format compatible with the popular jQuery library.

<h3>HTML5 Grids? Mobile Friendly Grids?</h3>
With mobile web set to surpass desktop browsing by 2015, (<a href="http://mashable.com/2010/04/13/mobile-web-stats/" title="mobile web set to surpass desktop by 2015">according to Morgan Stanley analysts</a>), one would assume that the next generation of javascript grids will need to cater to devices ranging from a mobile flip phone to a wide-screen TV.  They will also need to make the jump to HTML5 while continuing to provide fallback support for old browsers.  What new libraries will meet these needs, and what libraries have I missed that could be useful?

    'I recently received the following email:
<blockquote><b>NOTICE OF PENDING CLASS ACTION AND NOTICE OF PROPOSED SETTLEMENT</b>
<i>ANGEL FRALEY V. FACEBOOK, INC.</i>
You are receiving this e-mail because you may have been featured in a "Sponsored Story" on Facebook prior to December 3, 2012.
A federal court authorized this Notice. This is not a solicitation from a lawyer.
<b>Why did I get this notice?</b> This Notice relates to a proposed settlement ("Settlement") of a class action lawsuit ("Action") filed against Facebook relating to a particular Facebook feature called "Sponsored Stories." According to available records, you may be a "Class Member."
<b>What is the Action about?</b> The Action claims that Facebook unlawfully used the names, profile pictures, photographs, likenesses, and identities of Facebook users in the United States to advertise or sell products and services through Sponsored Stories without obtaining those users'' consent. Facebook denies any wrongdoing and any liability whatsoever. No court or other entity has made any judgment or other determination of any liability.
...
<b>What relief does the Settlement provide?</b> Facebook will pay $20 million into a fund that can be used, in part, to pay claims of Class Members (including Minor Class Members) who appeared in a Sponsored Story. Each participating Class Member who submits a valid and timely claim form may be eligible to receive up to $10.
...
</blockquote>

So, to sum that up: <strong>Facebook can use my face and my name to sell a product, without my consent, and in compensation they offer me 10$.</strong>  My identity and my privacy are worth 10$.  <em>Really?</em>  As the latest on a pile of insults and privacy violations from Facebook, this has led me to plan a "break up" with the social media monopoly.  Yet, finding a comparable and superior option for social networking has been difficult.  I''m on the fence about how exactly to keep in touch with my 390 Facebook friends and still retain a shred of privacy.

<!--more-->

The case for leaving Facebook is more than obvious at this point.  The <a href="http://paulbernal.wordpress.com/2012/12/27/10-reasons-to-leave-facebook/" title="10 reasons to leave facebook, by Paul Bernal">"10 reasons to leave Facebook"</a> post by IT/Media Law expert Paul Bernal is informative, and covers the issues of privacy, monopoly, and dependency, among others.  German researchers have found that <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/01/22/us-facebook-envy-idUKBRE90L0N220130122" title="Facebook Envy finding by German Researchers">hanging out on Facebook can leave one feeling miserable</a>.  I find that the experience of being on Facebook has changed completely from what it was when I first joined.

The question is, what other site or service can provide all of the following in one place?
<ul>
<li>Sharing albums of photos</li>
<li>Private messages to and from friends</li>
<li>Commenting on a "wall" or semi-public forum</li>
<li>Maintaining a profile that only approved "friends" can access</li>
<li>Chatting</li>
<li>Apps and games (although I personally have avoided those because of privacy concerns)</li>
<li>Sharing status updates and links to news, media, or funny images</li>
</ul>

In his post, Bernal suggests a strategy of decentralization- 
<q>"..use different services for different features. Use one provider for email, use twitter for mass communication, set up your own blog on a different provider, put your photos on your own website, play games on yet another and so forth..."</q>
So, following this logic, I could use Flickr for photo sharing, email and IM/IRC for messaging and chatting, forums for semi-public sharing, G+ for my profile, steam or the Google Play store for apps and games, and Twitter for status updates.  Not a bad idea, except that each of these platforms comes with it''s own privacy and security concerns.

Other alternatives exist:  <a href="http://quitfacebook.info/?page_id=144" title="Facebook Alternatives on Quit Facebook">QuitFacebook.info has a list of facebook-like options</a> that tend to emphasize privacy, open source, and distributed networks.  The most promising of the list include <a href="https://joindiaspora.com/" title="diaspora homepage">Diaspora</a>, <a href="http://freedomboxfoundation.org/" title="freedombox">Freedombox</a>, and <a href="http://mediagoblin.org/" title="mediagoblin">MediaGoblin</a>.  The problem in this case is that distributed networks require users to run their own server.  I am lucky enough to have space on a server to play around with, but few of my friends have the time or inclination to set up something like that for themselves.  Then again, getting space on a server or setting up a small home server is becoming more and more accessible to the average consumer.  Perhaps this won''t be a barrier in the coming years?

Considering the options brings up the bigger question of privacy on the internet in general.  Is privacy a realistic thing to pursue or to expect in today''s world?  Is the concept outdated?  I can''t stand the idea of Facebook putting my face in an advertisement, but maybe I''m just being touchy?',

To create these icons, I used some base vector icons from the <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Social_network_icons" title="Free Social Network Icons on Wikimedia Commons">free collection on the Wikimedia commons</a> and some of the SVG icons from <a href="http://fairheadcreative.com/" title="FairheadCreative homepage">FairheadCreative</a> (<a href="http://www.zurb.com/playground/social-webicons" title="Social Web Icons free download at Zurb.com">available at ZURB.com</a>).
Next, I vectorized the PNG images of a couple of Initials from <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Initials" title="Category: Initials at Wikimedia Commons">the collection at Wikimedia Commons</a>.  (They are the BEST source I have found for public domain and CC images!)  The ornaments from existing Initials served as inspiration for the design surrounding each social media symbol.

Because I created them, it is hard for me to judge whether they communicate clearly.  Is it obvious what each one is for?  What would you expect if you clicked each of these icons?',

CISPA, the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Information Act that sparked an uproar in 2012, is back.  So, what is CISPA about, and what''s the big deal?

<h3>The Original CISPA</h3>
CISPA was originally one of the <a href="http://flarnie.com/2012/censorship/cybersecurity-law/" title="Cybersecurity Acts proposed in 2012">wave of cybersecurity acts proposed early in 2012</a>, which included the controversial <a href="http://flarnie.com/2012/anti-sopapipa/sopa-hurts-us-all/" title="SOPA and PIPA post from 2012">SOPA and PIPA</a>. <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-57419540-281/opposition-grows-to-cispa-big-brother-cybersecurity-bill/?tag=contentMain;contentBody;1n" title="Opposition grows to CISPA Big Brother Cybersecurity Bill, CNET 2012">Protests were raised</a> over possible privacy violations that could result from the original bill, including petitions and calls to action from <a href="http://act.demandprogress.org/sign/cispa_facebook/?akid=1309.606560.hIzXuJ&rd=1&t=3" title="Original anti-CISPA petition from Demand Progress">Demand Progress</a>, <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/page/s/protect-our-privacy" title="Original anti-CISPA petition from Access Now">Access Now</a>, <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/04/eff-condemns-cispa-vows-take-fight-senate" title="EFF condemns CISPA, 2012 article">Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)</a>, <a href="http://act2.freepress.net/sign/cispa/?source=featurebox_fp" title="Original anti-CISPA petition from Save the Internet">Save The Internet</a>, and <a href="http://campaigns.dailykos.com/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=122" title="Original anti-CISPA petition from Daily KOs">Daily KOs</a>. (NOTE: The preceeding petitions and links are not connected with the 2013 version of CISPA, and are provided for historical context.  If you''re looking to take action and oppose the current version of CISPA, <a href="#take-action">skip to the end for ways to take action</a>.)  An excellent infographic from Lumin Consulting explains <a href="http://flarnie.com/2012/privacy/cispa-sopa-part-2/" title="2012 Infographic on CISPA">the concerns with the original bill</a>.

<h3>The New CISPA</h3>
Those who <a href="http://intelligence.house.gov/sites/intelligence.house.gov/files/documents/HR624.pdf" title="Current text of CISPA">read the text of CISPA</a> as it currently stands will be reassured by some key changes.

Is it enough to narrow the definitions of "Cyber Security Information" and "Cyber Security Threat"?

Despite these changes, concern has been raised by the EFF, Demand Progress, and others.    Mashable reports that already <a href="http://mashable.com/2013/02/15/cispa-petitions/" title="Mashable: Internet Activitsts Deliver 300,000 Anti-CISPA Signatures to Congress">"Internet Activists Deliver 300,000 Anti-CISPA Signatures to Congress"</a>.

Did you know that email is less private than a postcard?  ISPs and the government can and do <a href="http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/email-privacy-29610.html" title="Basic Guide to Email Privacy Legality from Nolo">store records of citizen email</a>, and <a href="http://boingboing.net/2013/03/09/new-bill-to-protect-your-webma.html" title="About ECPA Reform via Boing Boing">after 6 months any email is considered public, and can be accessed without a warrant</a>.

The main law protecting email privacy is the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, which was written back in 1986.  A proposed bill <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr983" title="H.R. 983 the Online Communications and Geolocation Protection Act">(H.R. 983)</a> would improve protections in the ECPA by requiring a warrant to access an individual''s email, and protecting geolocation data as well. 

Regular mail and phone conversations are protected, so why can''t the same be said of email?  If you''re worked up about this, <strong>please <a href="https://action.eff.org/o/9042/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=8225" title="petition for ECPA reform via EFF">sign the <abbr title="Electronic Frontier Foundation">EFF</abbr> petition</a> asking for support for this new bill.</strong>  If you''re not worked up yet, you may not have heard about the massive collection of citizen email by the US government-

<!--more-->
<h2>NSA Domestic Spying Program</h2>
According to whistleblower William Binney, formerly an NSA official, the government is keeping records of internet communications in the US, and accessing them as needed without warrant.
<iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/TuET0kpHoyM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<quote>"The problem is, if they think they haven''t done anything wrong- They don''t get to define that, the central government does.  ... If their position on something is against what the administration has, then they could easily become a target."</quote>

Even if you never make it on their "target list", your personal email might pop up in a search for someone else, and the idea of some stranger reading through personal email is so creepy.  If it <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/06/pinwale/" title="NSA ''inadvertently'' reads Bill Clinton''s personal email">happened to Bill Clinton</a>, it could happen to anyone.

Luckily, the Online Communications and Geolocation Protection Act will require that the government at least get a warrant before reading all that private email they have on file.

<h2>About the Online Communications and Geolocation Protection Act</h2>
The full text of the bill is available <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr6529/text" title="text of H.R. 983">here</a>.  This short bill makes three key changes to the Electronic Communications Privacy Act:
<ul>
<li>Updates terms and definitions to include email and data stored remotely (in "the cloud")
<li>Requires a warrant (not just a court order) to access email, regardless of how old the file is
<li>Adds protection of geolocation information.
</ul>

<h2>True Email Privacy</h2>
Even if a warrant is required to legally access personal email, there is always the chance that someone would read it anyway.  Using encryption is the only way to truly communicate privately online, and it''s actually not so hard to set up.  Here are some resources to learn more about email encryption:

An excerpt from a <a title="Copyright and Fair Use, from resources for life" href="http://www.resourcesforlife.com/docs/item6247#">great summary of Fair Use</a>:</small>
<blockquote><strong>Copyright and Fair Use</strong>

This website contains some quotations and excerpts from copyrighted material. These uses fall well within the copyright doctrine of “Fair Use.”

Section 107 of the United States Code, Title 17, specifies the conditions under which, “the fair use of a copyrighted work . . . for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching . . ., scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright.” It provides four considerations for determining fair use: (1) The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes, (2) The nature of the copyrighted work, (3) The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole, and (4) The effect of the use upon the potential market for, or value of, the copyrighted work.

The use on this website of other material is primarily for “criticism, comment, news reporting, scholarship or research” (and to some extent teaching). (1) (a) The “purpose and character” of the website (with no advertising) and any derivative book(s) (with few on-demand copies) are not “commercial.” (b) The overwhelming majority of the material is the author’s original work. It is in no way a mere collection of others’ copyrighted works, nor competitive with those sources. (2) The “nature of the copyrighted work” quoted is often “news” or “history,” categories given lesser protection in fair use cases than works of fiction. (3) Most uses involve excerpts rather than entire works.

Because the adverse financial impact on copyright owners is central to the purpose of copyright law, and the analysis of alleged violations, it’s relevant to note that, under factor (4), (a) no one in search of the quoted material would substitute this blog or book for the original source, (b) it is highly unlikely this website (or book created from it) will ever have more than a de minimis impact on any of the copyright works’ potential market, and (c) to the extent it might do so, it would be far more likely be a positive, rather than a negative, impact (by drawing attention to the work, crediting it, and providing a source where it may be found).

Finally, to the extent any copyright owner may wish, consideration will be given to all reasonable requests that copyright material be removed from this website and from future on-demand printings (there would be no back stock of books).</blockquote>

    'I recently had the opportunity to help someone with the issue of using glow on a set in Raphael JS.
<h2>Unglowing Sets is Hard</h2>
<a href="http://flarnie.com/2012/javascript/raphael-js-glow/" title="Raphael JS: Glow">Adding a ''glow'' effect in Raphael JS is easy</a>, but <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/raphaeljs/Sd6ru6_ct_g" title="Issues with Removing Glow from Sets">removing the glow is a different matter</a>.  As I have written about in a previous post (<a href="http://flarnie.com/2012/javascript/removing-glow-in-raphael-js/" title="Removing Glow in Raphael JS">Removing Glow in Raphael JS</a>), there is <a href="https://github.com/DmitryBaranovskiy/raphael/issues/508" title="Glow Removal Bug in Raphael JS">a known bug in the Raphael JS JavaScript Library''s Glow Function</a> that causes the .remove() function to delete the parent element as well or instead of the ''glow'' that was targeted.  
My solution <a href="http://flarnie.com/2012/javascript/removing-glow-in-raphael-js/" title="Removing Glow in Raphael JS">demonstrates removing glow for a Raphael object that is wrapped in a link</a>, but it <strong>does not work for elements in a set:</strong>
<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="http://jsfiddle.net/paradasia/Tape7/3/embedded/result,js,resources,html,css/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>
As you can see, the parent element disappears when the mouse leaves the dots, but the yellow "glow" remains.
<strong>However, there is hope!</strong>
<h2>How to Unglow Sets in Raphael JS</h2>
For better or worse, truly removing the "glow" from a set at this time is not possible.  However, a plain old <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_obj_array.asp" title="JavaScript Array tutorial on W3 Schools">JavaScript array</a> can act just like a Raphael "set" and <strong>does allow for adding and removing "glow" from the created Raphael objects.</strong>
<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="http://jsfiddle.net/paradasia/jsr2s/9/embedded/result,js,resources,html,css/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>
Above you can see the working demo- two arrays that act as "sets", each holding two dots.  They can be assigned attributes as a group, and the glow effect can be applied or removed from the "set" by using the vanilla JavaScript forEach method.  (<a href=" https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach" title="forEach documentation from Mozilla">Read about forEach in Mozilla''s Documentation.</a>)
The example JavaScript is included below the cut:

This method is more complex, but in the end is more reliable than hacking the internals of the Raphael JS library.  It is the only work-around I have found, but I would love to know any others!

In the field of user interface design, there is an entire category of user error that arises from the inclusion of “modes”.  In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Donald-Norman/dp/0465067107" title="Design of Everyday Things, by Donald Norman, book on Amazon">The Design of Everyday Things</a>, Donald Norman explains that <q>“Mode errors are inevitable any time equipment is designed to have more possible actions than it has controls or displays, so the controls must do double duty.”</q> (110)

In order to avoid having controls "do double duty", there is one simple rule to follow: 
<strong>One button has one function.</strong>
That''s all there is to it.

For this principle of design we can thank Larry Tesler, who made it his personal crusade to “eliminate modes from software design” during his work on the early desktop user interface at Xerox PARC.  The cause became so central to his life that his license plate read <strong>“NO MODES”</strong>, and he reportedly wore the slogan “Don''t Mode Me In” on a t-shirt. (For more about Larry Tesler, see the end of this talk by Bret Victor: <a href="http://vimeo.com/36579366#t=38m0s" title="talk by Brett Victor on living passionately">http://vimeo.com/36579366#t=38m0s</a> )

Despite my personal affection for <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/" title="Gnu Emacs">Emacs</a>, (a classic text and code editing program which does use modes), the avoidance of “modes” is one of many design principles I strive to follow in my own applications.',

I recently updated this blog/portfolio with a new WordPress theme that is responsive and mobile-friendly.  Hooray!
Details below the cut~

<h2>Fluid Layout</h2>
To achieve a fluid layout, start with a layout based on percent (fluid) units of measurement and use a set of media queries to adjust for very large or very small screen sizes.  Note that setting the ''width'' property of elements is all that is needed- assigning a ''height'' property as a percentage value will have no effect unless you have an assigned height for all containing elements, up to the ''body'' and parent ''html'' element. 
Even with containing elements that adjust to the width of the screen, some details will look strange when screens shrink or grow too much. To achieve a design that works consistenly, use CSS3 media queries to set custom styles for ''max-width'' and ''min-width'', like so:
<code>@media screen and (max-width: /*target width here*/px) {.../*your css*/ }</code>
<code>@media screen and (min-width: /*target width here*/px) {.../*your css*/ }</code>
CSS Tricks has <a href="http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/media-queries-for-standard-devices/" title="CSS3 media queries for standard devices, from CSS Tricks">a nice collection of CSS3 media query snippets targeting various device sizes</a>, for reference.
<h2>Mobile Friendly Images with CSS Only</h2>
In many cases, it really is acceptable to resize your images with CSS only.  To ensure that your images appear at the largest size available without overflowing the containing elements, set <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/max-width" title="CSS- Max Width documentation from Mozilla">the ''max-width'' property</a> to 100% in your CSS.
<code>.your-class {
max-width: 100%;
}
</code>
Though the use of CSS to resize images was decried in the 90''s when broadband was limited and browsers less powerful, and <a href="http://webdesign.about.com/cs/graphics/qt/tipimgrealsize.htm" title="About.com recommends always resizing your images manually">some still warn against it</a>, it is now a viable way to achieve responsive images.  <a href="http://www.roytanck.com/2010/03/26/browsers-are-pretty-quick-at-scaling-images/" title="Browsers are pretty quick at scaling images">A quick test found that <strong>there really is no difference in loading time</strong> for desktop users with modern browsers.</a>  My own tests of mobile loading times also show that images load within a reasonable amount of time, so go ahead and use CSS if your site is not unusually image-heavy.

While things have been quiet on this blog, I <a href="http://app-academy-hacker.tumblr.com/" title="app academy hacker blog">posted a storm of entries during App Academy that can be read on "App Academy Hacker"</a>.

While I don''t see myself teaching in the long-term, it is a fantastic opportunity to continue learning and work with intelligent, highly skilled people.

<p>In the jsfiddle version I had to add <code>font-size: 0px;</code> to the parent div to completely fix the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1833734/display-inline-block-extra-margin" title="inline block extra margin stackoverflow answer">spacing issues caused by <code>inline-block</code></a>.  Oddly enough, in my initial version (an html page that can be opened locally in the browser), this wasn''t necessary.  The <a href="http://https://github.com/paradasia/coding-kata/tree/master/css-js-examples/front-end-examples" title="css and html demos on github">full version with separate files for html and css is posted on github</a>, along with some of my other css and html demos.</p>
<h2>Layout Without Hacks?</h2>
<p>While both of the approaches shown above avoid using tables for layout, both also involve using a hack.  With <code>inline-block</code>, you have to eliminate whitespace from the HTML and use <code>font-size: 0px;</code> on the parent element.  With <code>float</code>, the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/211383/which-method-of-clearfix-is-best" title="which clear-fix is the best?">clear-fix hack</a> is required to keep the parent element from collapsing.</p>
<p>Once browsers start supporting the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Flexible_boxes" title="using css flexbox">flexbox model</a>, it will be GREAT to finally have layout without hacks.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> I''m working with Rails 3.2.14.  It should work pretty much the same way for Rails 4+ applications.</p>
<p>This is especially useful if you''re writing a Backbone.js, Angular, or Ember application and have a lot of content that is loaded dynamically by javascript.</p>
<!--more-->
<h2>Step 1: Set up RSpec</h2>
<p>If you''ve already set up RSpec with Capybara, then skip this step.</p>
<p>When starting a brand new Rails application, you can <a href="https://gist.github.com/flarnie/7070115" title="RSpec and FactoryGirl Setup Template">use my template to auto-complete most of the steps</a>.  If you''ve already generated your Rails app, then follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Add the following gems to your gemfile and run `<code>bundle install</code>` in the terminal:
<pre lang="ruby">
gem_group :test do
  gem ''rspec-rails''
  gem ''factory_girl_rails''
  gem ''faker''
  gem ''capybara''
  gem ''guard-rspec''
  gem ''launchy''
end
</pre>
  <ul><li>`<code>faker</code>`, `<code>guard-rspec</code>`, `<code>launchy</code>`, and `<code>factory_girl_rails</code>` are all optional gems that will be super helpful to you when writing your specs.  Brief summaries below:
    <ul><li><a href="http://faker.rubyforge.org/" title="Faker Documentation">Faker</a>: generates interesting fake data for testing purposes, from Lorem Ipsum to names and emails.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/guard/guard-rspec" title="Guard-RSpec Documentation">Guard-Rspec</a>: Runs your specs for you automatically when you make changes to your application code.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/copiousfreetime/launchy" title="Launchy gem documentation">Launchy</a>: Enables the <a href="http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/ever-heard-of-capybaras-save_and_open_page-method/" title="Ever Heard of Capybaras save_and_open_page method? blog post by Jeff KreeftMeijer"><code>save_and_open_page</code></a> command with Capybara, which will live preview the page as Capybara/Rspec sees it.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl/blob/master/GETTING_STARTED.md" title="FactoryGirl Rails: Getting Started">FactoryGirl</a>: Great gem by ThoughtBot that replaces the default Rails fixtures with more extensible factories.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>This code will put the gems in the <code>:test</code> group, meaning they are only loaded when you run your specs.  This is nice, because we don''t want to load libraries unless they are needed.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Run `<code>rails g rspec:install</code>` in the terminal.</li>
<li>Add the following configurations in your `<code>application.rb</code>` configuration file:
<pre lang="ruby">
  config.generators do |g|
    g.test_framework :rspec,
      :fixtures => true, 
      :view_specs => false,
      :helper_specs => false,
      :routing_specs => false,
      :controller_specs => true,
      :request_specs => true
    g.fixture_replacement :factory_girl, :dir => "spec/factories"
  end
</pre>
This tells Rails to auto-generate RSpec test files instead of it''s own inferior testing files, and to use FactoryGirl instead of it''s native fixtures library.  The individiual options specify which types of specs to auto-generate, for example: `<code>:view_specs => false</code>` tells Rails not to auto-generate spec files for your views.  Since we''re using feature specs, you won''t necessarily want specs for views as well.
</li>
<li>In your `<code>spec/spec_helper.rb</code>` file, add the line `<code>require ''capybara/rspec''</code>` to the top, right after the other `<code>require</code>` statements.</li>
</ol>
<p>Great!  Now you should be able to run the command `<code>rspec</code>` in your terminal and see the following output:
<pre>
No examples found.


Finished in 0.0001 seconds
0 examples, 0 failures
</pre>

<h2>Step 2: Write a some feature tests</h2>
<p>To see if things are working, we''ll want some feature specs to run.  If you don''t have any pages ready for testing in your Rails application, then <a href="https://gist.github.com/flarnie/9857100" title="Feature test for ToDoMVC:Backbone.js">use these specs</a> to run tests of the ToDoMVC Backbone.js demo app.</p>
This gist is an example of a basic feature spec.  This is also an example of an <em>integration spec</em>, because it tests many parts of the application working together.  For the user to create and delete to-do items, the controller, routes, view, and javascript must all be working correctly.
<script src="https://gist.github.com/flarnie/9857100.js"></script>

<h2>Step 3: Set up Selenium for Capybara</h2>
<p>At this point, your specs should be failing because Capybara doesn''t load your javascript.</p>
<p>How to get RSpec to load your javascript when it runs the specs?
<ol>
  <li>The main thing required is to add `<code>:js => true</code>` to each spec that you want to load javascript.</li>
  <li>Add two more gems to your `<code>group :test</code>` in the `<code>Gemfile</code>`: 
<pre lang="ruby">
gem ''selenium-webdriver''
gem ''database_cleaner''
</pre>
<p>The `<code>selenium-webdriver</code>` gem will let us use Selenium as the webdriver when running your feature specs.  We didn''t need the `<code>database_cleaner</code>` gem before because RSpec usually runs each spec inside of a Rails Database Transaction, and rolls back all changes after each spec.  <strong>However</strong>, when using Selenium we don''t have those transactions any more, so you can manually clean the database after each spec using the `<code>database-cleaner</code>` gem.</p>
<p>Remember to `<code>bundle install</code>`!</p>
</li>
<li>Near the top of your `<code>spec/spec_helper.rb</code>` file, after the other `<code>require</code>` statements, add the following: 
<code>require ''database_cleaner''
DatabaseCleaner.strategy = :truncation 
</code>
<p>Then, further down in the same file, after the line that says `<code>RSpec.configure do |config|  </code>`, you''ll see a line that says `<code> config.use_transactional_fixtures = true</code>`.  Change that to be the following:</p>
<pre lang="ruby">
config.use_transactional_fixtures = false

config.before :each do
  DatabaseCleaner.start
end

config.after :each do 
  DatabaseCleaner.clean
end
</pre>
<p>This tells Rails to clean the test database after each spec using the `<code>database_cleaner</code>` gem we added earlier, rather than the default RSpec transactions.</p>
<p>If you want to use Selenium for all of your specs by default, then add the line `<code>Capybara.default_driver = :selenium</code>` to your `<code>spec/spec_helper.rb</code>` file.  The details about setting the Capybara driver are <a href="https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara#selecting-the-driver" title="Capybara: Selecting the driver">here in the documentation</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Enjoy!</h2>
<p>With the Selenium webdriver, you simply add the `<code>:js => true</code>` option to your specs and Selenium Webdriver will open Firefox and click around in your application right in front of your eyes.  Pretty sweet!</p>

    '<p>To easily bind any keyboard shortcut, even the most complex, to your JavaScript callback, I''ve created a little library called <a href="http://flarnie.github.io/golden_key/" title="Golden Key javascript keybinding library">Golden Key</a>.  It needs another round of testing and some code review before I release it on NPM and Bower, but then I know it will be useful for some of my ongoing and future projects.  Since learning Vim, I''m really addicted to keyboard shortcuts!</p>

<h2>Golden Key Features:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bind multiple keyboard shortcuts at once by creating an events hash.  (Inspired by the event handling in ''views'' when using Backbone JS, as demonstrated in the fourth section of <a href="http://backbonetutorials.com/what-is-a-view/" title="Explanation of the view in Backbone JS.">this article</a>.)
<li>Configure the timing of key sequences. (Meaning how long the user can pause between keys.)
<li>Use both sequences and modified keys to build custom shortcuts. (Meaning your shortcuts can involve hitting several keys in a row, or hitting several keys at the same time.)
<li>Optionally bind a callback to catch and parse all keys pressed, in addition to binding specific keyboard shortcuts.
</ul>
<p><strong>Coming Soon:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Unbind events as needed
<li>Bind combinations of keys including modified keys (Example: Using a leader key combination that involves a modifier, followed by another combination.)
<li>Bind keyboard shortcuts to specific elements on the page, or blacklist certain elements (inputs for example) from triggering the keyboard shortcuts.
